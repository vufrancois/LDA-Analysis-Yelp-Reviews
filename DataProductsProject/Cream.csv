The burgers are pretty good and the shakes are a must have. However, the customer service is not so good. The lady behind the counter is rude for no reason. My last visit there was 10-21-17 and the lady was super rude. I asked for ice water for my yeti cup and I would pay the difference and she said we don't give ice for personal cups you have to buy a cup of ice water. I said oh, no problem I will pay for the ice water either way I just wanted ice water as I had been working at a near home close by. So, as I waited on my meal and the water the lady proceeds to tell her co-worker about what just happened. Saying, this lady (which is me) had the audacity to ask for ice water for her cup and I told her no she would have to buy it. I hate people thinking they can get things for free. I was in complete shock that she would re-tell this incident like I was not still standing there listening to her re-tell this story.

My boyfriend told me that this place had a great simple burger, so I tried it with him. The location is kinda sketchy, I wouldn't dare go alone, especially at night, but I try not to judge restaurants by their appearances.We got two large chilicheeseburgers, a chilicheese dog, and a large order of fries. We were the only ones there, and it felt like forever before we got our food. Our order took probably around 15-20 min, which was waaaay longer than I thought it should've taken. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt though because it was pretty late and they probably didn't think anybody else would come before closing time, so they may have started cleaning up already. Also, it was just the one woman working by herself. Now, I was already informed that these weren't gourmet burgers at all, but I expected burgers that were better than McDonalds. I was disappointed. I felt like I had just gotten McDonalds burgers with everything in it, but it took three times as long as it should've. I'm not hating on McDonalds, I actually like their burgers, but I feel like, considering time, McDonald's would be the better option. Also, I barely had any chili in my chilicheeseburger, but my boyfriend had plenty. The hot dog was something I could've easily made at home by microwaving packaged store-bought hot dogs and putting lots of chili, a little cheese, and onions on top. The bun was yummy, and the hot dog was fine, don't get me wrong, but I would've preferred making this at home for a lot cheaper. I like the thick cut style of their fries, but their fries were soggy. I'm fine with soggy fries, I actually prefer it, but for those of you who like crispy fries, you're out of luck here. Also, apparently, there was salt added on top, but I didn't get any. All of the fries I had tasted just like soggy plain potatoes. Not really much flavor. I guess you could add salt if you want to, but that makes me feel guilty. On the bright side, they didn't skimp on the large fries. That amount would've been enough for me as a meal. Unfortunately, when it comes down to it, I would rather go to McDonald's than this place. They have more options and they work much faster. I think this place is more of a neighborhood hangout with lifelong loyal customers.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,cream-burger-houston,cream-burger-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/cream-burger-houston?start=0,Vicki L.,"Anchorage, AK",93,124,546,Elite ’17,4/22/16,"Fat juicy burgers tasted like homemade.

The menu is simple: burgers, 'dogs (with the chili and cheese varieties of both), fries, ice cream, and milkshakes. Don't expect a gourmet burger. The lettuce will be shredded, the onion diced, and the mustard plain yellow, but you can count on it being fresh-made and on a toasted bun.

Don't talk on your cell phone. The food was deliciously greasy. I'm a big fan of artery clogging foods. Seriously, I probably already have cholesterol issues. The fries actually had flavor! It seemed like most people were ordering shakes, and I hear they're pretty good. Next time I go I'll get a shake. The place is open late, and would make an amazing drunk food, but I wouldn't go after dark unless you're with a bunch of people.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,cream-burger-houston,cream-burger-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/cream-burger-houston?start=40,Dennis L.,"Washington, DC",24,96,14,,2/11/09,"The quick line: Solid burger, at a very, very low price.You're probably going to have to get your order to go - there is no indoor seating, just a couple of small tables outside under the eaves. This is pretty much a classic burger shack. I'll be honest, it's not in the nicest part of town. But that's what makes it so cheap.The burger is quite good, and reasonably hefty. The hand-formed patties are smashed pretty thin, so they get a good bit of char and crispy bits on the grill. The buns are toasted as well, and the burger ""all the way"" comes with mustard, lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickles. Good, beefy flavor, and even though it's cooked through, is pretty juicy (some of that is definitely coming from the veggies, though). Fries are nothing to write home about, but they get the job done.All in all, if you're nearby and want a good burger at a low price, you should consider Cream Burger. Everything is made to order, so you'll have to wait a few minutes, but it's totally worth it. I've driven by during the lunch hour and it's usually packed; you might want to try off hours if you hate waiting.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,cream-burger-houston,cream-burger-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/cream-burger-houston?start=40,Brandy C.,"Long Beach, CA",148,73,29,,8/6/14,$10 bucks works for 2 people. burgers are off the hook.,"alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,cream-burger-houston,cream-burger-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/cream-burger-houston?start=40,Sophia V.,"Houston, TX",227,141,659,,4/5/11,"The burgers are really cheap here!

I usually eat in the hood or not in good neighborhood. Is that healthy, hmm nope. But i like to support good business in bad areas. Cream of Burger has been in third ward, i believe FOREVER. It is a good place to eat and relax. Now when you go there, YES, IT WILL LOOK UGLY, DIRTY ETC. (anything that you can think negative that how it look on the out side). But in the inside you will get a damm good hamburger adn some good ice cream. Yes, i eat there on a regular. Anyone that went to U of H might know where it is at. Also, you get alot for a good price money. So i give cream of burger 4 stars...

I mean, REALLY cheap. The burger is just so-so. The bun is nice and toasty but the patty is too thin. The area is pretty ghetto. You probably don't want to go when it's dark or by yourself in general if you're a gal. The lady taking your order is really nice -- just make sure you speak up and aren't on your cellphone.Pass on the milkshake. I had the strawberry one and while it did taste nice and homemade (extra milky) it wasn't very flavorful and was a bit runny. Unless I was in the area already, I'd rather spend a few more bucks and get a better burger.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,cream-burger-houston,cream-burger-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/cream-burger-houston?start=40,nkenge b.,"Houston, TX",21,14,,,10/21/11,Love this place Ive been going here for more than 10 yrs.

My mother used to give us all the story about Prince's Burgers and how it served up the best burgers in Houston long ago.... I was honestly the one who was satisfied with getting one from Sonic or Whataburger at that age - as long as I had cheese I could care less about the quality. Thinking back, this is the one burger joint that has the authentic, grimy feel of a grease box, and the flavors to match. If you are searching for the Five Guys/ In N Out/ Ray's Hellburger-kind-of-place... sorry, not the one. If you want a fresh, hot burger served right off the grill as if you were in your own backyard - stop by the Cream Burger. BTW, I never understood why they named it that - maybe because their milkshakes bring all the boys to the yard???","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,cream-burger-houston,cream-burger-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/cream-burger-houston?start=40,Colleen L.,"Portland, OR",0,13,,,9/9/09,"Very, very cheap but still good food. The regular hamburger is only $1.40 and the regular cheeseburger is $1.70. The burgers also come in ""large"" and ""double"" sizes. They also have chiliburgers and chili/hot dogs. Shakes, Floats, and Ice Cream on the menu as well. I ordered a cheeseburger and a rootbeer float. There's almost always a line at this place. It has been in the neighborhood for a long time and is very popular in the neighborhood. Business hours are til midnight. There's only 2 round tables to sit down at (outside-only seating) and they're usually taken. Most people seem to get their food to go because of that. Popular with the kids too because of the ice cream options.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,cream-burger-houston,cream-burger-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/cream-burger-houston?start=40,Jay H.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,,8/30/09,"Cream burger is a part of the history of third ward. The burger and shake ultimately go together like any two combo's you can imagine, although the burger seems a little salty at times. The lady at the window has an attitude so I have been reluctant to ask them to make it with light salt which would make it the perfect burger for the perfect price.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,cream-burger-houston,cream-burger-houston
