Shilcutt likes this place so that should tell you something.The overall user experience: I felt like I needed to tightly clutch my Hello Kitty backpack.The inside was a filthy fucking cramped hovel. And I lived in a frat house in college girlfriend. What is this??? This is not an aesthetic you want. The floor was dirty. The window bars (classy!) were stained, greasy, and looked like they hadn't been cleaned since the Nixon administration. The counter was just as dirty. The little dividey post so two lines can form, one along the register and one behind it, was the dirtiest of everything. I had to run home to wash my hoodie and then to fill up my bathtub with rather manly lavender moisturizing hand sanitizer and splash around in it to get all of the nasty off of me. I have been less viscerally disgusted by bus station hookers.Chris Rock used to have a bit about streets named MLK. Big Belly is a few blocks away and that street has a very strong police presence. So much so the other day I was trying to remember if I had done anything bad with an open statute of limitations. So I was a little surprised that on MLK (gun store, liquor store, gun store, liquor store) there was not a single 5-0 up and down that whole stretch of road. None. My mother's rule is that this is a bad thing, because their visibility offers some limited protection. This is why she thinks I am going to get stabbed in the Marigny for general in-the-wrong-place-at-the-wrong-time reasons (rather than specific reasons like my big mouth saying ""what're you gonna do sweetheart, stab me?"") because the one time I tried to take her to a bar in the Marigny she walked two blocks without seeing NOPD and noped out of there back to the CBD. There is a small lot that wraps round the front facing MLK and on around the side, which turns into a delightful muddy ditch. The parking regime appears to be 'do whatever the fuck you want, fam' because that is how everyone parked. I was not only boxed in by one, but two cars that double/triple parked me. By the time the brothers got those things out of the way, the truck that parked behind me in a spot had such a huge truck I had a few inches of clearance to back out. I felt like Austin Powers backing out that little truck between the two walls. I recommend that they start penalizing and publicly shaming these animals so they quit parking like jerks. I would never risk the Dragon's well-being to come back here.The customer service was severely lacking - no friendliness or otherwise acknowledgement that I chose to come here rather than a competitor of theirs. But to give them credit, they do answer their phone and take your order to save time waiting here any longer than you have to (but you still need to wait in line as manners are lost on your peers and they cut in front of you without remorse, because thug lyfe obvi.)Like Big Belly they didn't have their menu anywhere but google poz and I hate that beta social network so I helpfully added the menu here. My meal was relatively inexpensive: $6.60 for a bacon cheeseburger and the medium order of fries. The fries come wrapped up in a cute bow. I will give them that, it is kawaii. But the fries are terrible. Fresh out of the bag a mere thirty seconds after you get it they are already soggy. They are swamped with salt. This is too much salt to be tasty. If I wanted a salt lick I would just buy a horse and use his salt lick in the barn.There are numerous problems with the burger. The patty is thin, so they are going to need to bring the flavor strong so the toppings and bun don't drown it out. This is the dullest, most flavorless patty in existence out of hospital cafeterias. And it was extremely well done to the point of being scorched-crispy. The only flavor in the first bite was the bitter taste of this being a failure pile of sadness. The cheese is not fully melted and because it's the Kraft singles sort, the parts that don't melt just clump up in off-putting and unattractive textures. The bacon was not only barely present, but suffered the same salt-torture the fries did. Because of how that one Femanon eats hamburgers in the top bun only--patty only--bottom bun only weird method, at least I was able to salvage the bun. This was a pathetic burger that a 5 year old child aspiring to be a chef would be ashamed of serving to a human, dog, or horse. I think they can do better, but they just don't care. The entire operation is indicative of them not caring - poor customer service, filthy building, and devil-may-care parking situation out front.This place has so much room for improvement to give them anything other than one star would be to reward their profound, ample, and myriad failures.","alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,burger-park-houston,burger-park-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/burger-park-houston?start=0,Kim B.,"Houston, TX",0,7,,,6/14/16,Urban and awesome!!!!!!!

I feel guilty only paying about $4 for a such a good bacon cheeseburger. There's no seating inside, so you take it to go, eat in the car or at one of their tables in the covered area outside.

Let me clear things up... NO its not in a fancy part of town, NO you can't get eggs or guac on these burgers and that's what makes it awesome! It's just good old fashioned burgers from a hood burger joint that's made with grease and love. If you are looking for a burger artisan experience, keep it moving, but if you want a hot made to order burger that doesn't charge an arm and leg then this is the place to go. It burned down about a month ago and since it's rebuilt, tastes even better, they probably just burned the roaches and vermin out lol. Another review wrote it's not authentic because an Asian is making the burger.

I work right around the corner from this place and once I call it in, by the time I get there it is all ready. Rarely do I have to wait for it very long once I am there. For $6 I can get a double cheeseburger, fries and a canned soda. The burgers are very good for the price and I would much rather eat it from there as opposed to going to BK, McDonalds or really any other drive thru burger joint. I have also had the chicken fried steak sandwich and grilled chicken sandwich and they are both really good.The one complaint I would have, and I hope they read this! is: I always order my fries crispy or extra crispy. Only about 20% of the time do I actually get them out crispy. When done like that they are as good a fries as you can find anywhere, when they arent, they are hardly edible to me (cause obviously I like them crispy).Regardless of that fact I would recommend this little joint to anyone rollin through South Park.!","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,burger-park-houston,burger-park-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/burger-park-houston?start=0,Kayla B.,"Houston, TX",10,37,63,,10/23/14,"A-ma-zing!!!!

Eventually things got a little bit out of control and teachers were asking us to get food for them. It got to the point where we would call in an order of like 50 burgers half an hour before lunch, then someone would sneak away at the beginning of lunch to pick up our cardboard box piled high with sweet goodness. Lets be honest here, the place is a dump. The first time i saw it, i just made the assumption that it was an old place that had been closed for years, not the open staple of eating in South Park that it is. There are burglar bars everywhere, as if they did pay day advances, not burgers. The burgers are really good though, and the patties taste really beefy. The fries are pretty good and if you get a meal you get to pick a flavored slushy that will turn your tongue crazy colors (think the grape and other flavor ""drink"" that have suspiciously industrial labels that every seven year old has at their birthday party). The best part of all: the whole meal is like $2. You just can't beat that.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,burger-park-houston,burger-park-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/burger-park-houston?start=0,Simone B.,"Corpus Christi, TX",113,5,1,,6/14/11,"I first heard about Burger Park 10 years ago when I attended a university in Houston. My husband and I decided to make the drive from George Bush just to try these burgers. We went with the doublemeat meal and added cheese. These burgers make the cut with some of the best that I have every tasted. Your order is grilled and made to order on the spot. Bread was grilled just right with crispy edges, they dont add a lot of cheese (I wouldve preferred another slice), and the fries were super hot. Our food came out so hot we decided to sit under their little canopy or whatever you call it and eat our meal there. It was 7:20 and we had no idea that they closed at 7:30. There were at least 10 cars that showed up to make it during the last five minutes before closing time. I heard someone say that they were praying that the place was still open. The slushes got saved until the end and we drank them on the way back. I don't know if I should be sickened at the amount of sugar that I drank or think that it was very inventive of them to get two slush machines that run continuously with non flavored slush and just add syrup similar to syrup that gets pumped over a snow cone to each cup. Anyway, I enjoyed it thoroughly and I'll definitely be back!","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,burger-park-houston,burger-park-houston
