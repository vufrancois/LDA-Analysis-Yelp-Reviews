I'm not a barbecue aficionado. My overall rating is based on the total dining experience... the food, the decor, the atmosphere, the service and the special Texas hospitality that my family received when we ate here (I may also have been prejudiced by my daughter's opinion that Pizzitola's is the best barbecue in Houston). We ordered a variety of dishes, sides and drinks and everyone thought that it was great. The owner (Mr. P?) was there and he did regale us with some history of the establishment and the area. He is a charm.P.S. I don't know where some of these reviewers are going because we spent $22/person which is less than a better known barbecue place that we visited during the same get-together here in Houston.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-housthttps://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston?start=0,Geo F.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,,8/30/17,"During one of the worst times in Houston or also one of the worst times of my life the flood evacuation and the third time evacuating just gets on your last nerve you go in this place you place an order their incredible they are truly what Houston spirit is all about and the two sixpacks of free stay calm beer made me laugh how cool are these folks thank you Lord for let me live in Texas and especially Houston and please look over this staff and great attitude this business is one of the stars over TexasIGod bless all and keep us safe that's Texas and God bless the Texans","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-housthttps://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston?start=0,Vlad V.,"The Heights, Houston, TX",183,595,156,Elite ’17,6/23/17,"Pizzitola's Bar-B-Cue has been around for a long time. They've been around far before the BBQ explosion happened in Houston. They're also at a great location in the Heights on Shepherd. I had dinner there on a Tuesday and was able to find a spot in their small lot. Pizzitola's looks like a country BBQ joint. No frills with a lot of memorabilia adorning the walls. Since I wasn't feeling any of the sides, they don't have fries, mac and cheese, or anything like that, I just went with the ribs. An order of ribs consists of three ribs with warm BBQ sauce, two slices of bread, and pickles. Not a big meal by any means so I'd recommend a combo which comes with two sides if you're hungry. Since my entree wasn't too much, I had the bread pudding for dessert. Everything overall was below average. Pizzitola's just can't hang with the BBQ heavyweights that have sprouted up around town. They're known for their ribs but I wasn't impressed. Service was good, the BBQ was just lacking compared to spots like Killen's or The Pit Room.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-housthttps://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston?start=0,travis l.,"Houston, TX",13,111,22,Elite ’17,11/2/17,"It was a real gully washer as my father in law might say last Saturday when wifey and I were cruising the heights for a place to eat. I had been to Pizzatola's many years in the past and remembered their ribs being on point. As we stepped out of the rain into the BBQ joint we were immediately welcomed by some awesome smokiness and one of the owners I believe his hame is Josh. My wife ordered the brisket with a double side of vegetables and I did the same but instead with the ribs. The ribs are classic dalmatian rub accented with an awesome ruby red smoke ring. They leave the silver skin on but it renders into the rib to a non chewy snap in your mouth consistency. The sauce is simple Texas style with a very balanced tomato and vinegar frofile. Nothing to ride home about but it started to grow on me throughout the meal. My wife's brisket was a good mix of lean and fatty cuts. It was cooked perfectly and really good, but not as good as the ribs. The highlight of the meal was when Josh came out and have us some ""on the house"" samples of their off the menu smoked turkey breast and sausage. The sausage was really good, reminded me of Kountry Boys on crack. The turkey was a game changer. It was perfectly seasoned and had a crust of thyme and other seasonings that really spoke to me on that rainy day. This is going to be something I splurge for on Thanksgiving this year.

Full disclosure: this ranking has a caveat. I am from Memphis, TN which we consider to be the Mecca of all things BBQ. I give all Texas BBQ an automatic 3 star deduction because beef with onions and pickles isn't proper QUE....having said that, I give this place back one star for a solid 3! I got the pulled pork plate with slaw and grilled veggies. (On a diet so no tater salad). It wasn't Memphis quality by any means. The meat was too moist almost like it was cooked in a crock pot. But the flavor was there and the slaw was nice and creamy! (Of course I put that slaw on top of my pork and covered with sauce before eating it.) I told them I was from Memphis and it was my first visit so they gave me a free rib and slid of brisket. They were both good! I will give the rib thumbs up even though there wasn't any rub. Sauce was typical Texas sauce, which I don't prefer. But overall it's a good spot. I probably won't come back because I save my BBQ cravings for when I travel home.

It may been a bright and shining star at one point in it's BBQ life, but no more. There are much better options at the same price points in the greater Houston area, Rudy's for example. Our party of three ordered the three meats special which consisted of pork ribs, white meat chicken slices, and pulled pork at $25. The friendly manager also gave us some briskets and sausages for free! We also ordered the three sides special at $8 which consisted of cole slaw, ranch beans, and potato salad. For desert we splitted the banana pudding. Let's get the sides out of the way, boring. The sides were no better than what you may get a HEB grocery store. The proteins came with three different types of BBQ sauce on the side, excellent idea. Out of the five meats, the pork ribs was the best. Pizzitola's is famous for it's pork ribs and it showed with perfect simple seasoning and moist meat. The worst was the chicken, it did not tasted like it ever been touch by any wood smoke. The rest of the meats were ok with the briskets being second best being moist and ok seasoned. The banana pudding was excellent, so country, so smooth, and so banana tasty. So one star was received due to the good pork ribs and pudding. The other two stars were from the excellent table service and old Texas country diner style decor of the place. The friendly manager recognized that we were not regular gave us some free foods to try which was very kind. The waitress was also very friendly and attentive. The waitress also gave us hot and moist cloths to clean ourselves which I think every BBQ shack should do. If we live in the Height, Pizzitola's is a acceptable option for BBQ ribs and briskets.

That's like a sit-down Mexican restaurant not offering tequila. It's not a good sign. I had read about this place as a BBQ landmark in Houston for how long it had been in business and how great the ribs were so naturally I was intrigued. Upon entry I was greeted by a very friendly waitress/cashier/manager, for all I knew. She asked me if I was ready to taste the best ribs in my life. Skeptical yet very interested I ordered a rack with a few sides, and unfortunately a water. The ribs were fairly mediocre and the sides were above average. The water was great though!!

Most of it ended up in the trash. The beans were just okay -- edible, but nothing to write home about. All of the barbecue was disappointing, especially the pulled pork. I ended up mixing up the rest of it in my dog's food. He liked it much more than we did. The barbecue sauce was okay, but it was really thin.

No one can beat my dad's BBQ, so I don't try to find restaurants that will serve me what I can get homemade at dad's house. As for Pizzitola's, it was pretty good. I had the brisket which had just enough fat and it was plenty moist. The flavor was very good and not too salty. Their sides are a bit boring. I think they would have more business if they had fresh sides - and cooler options. I tried ordering the grilled vegetables, but they were ""out."" I still don't see how you run out of grilled vegetables. I got the potato salad and pinto beans instead. The waitress asked if I wanted cheese and onions on it, so I said ""Sure, why not,"" later to discover the dollar charge for it. When we first entered, we were greeted by a young man who was full of spirit. He sadly informed us that they had run out of ribs for the day, so he offered us cards to get a half rack free on our next order (with the purchase of a full rack, of course). He then offered to show us the old-time brick oven in the back of the restaurant and since this was our first visit, we went to check it out. He was very eager to make us feel at home. The waitress was not so enthusiastic, but she did her job. For this little run-down hut of a restaurant, I think the prices might be slightly high, especially since the sides are not too thrilling, to say the least.

Simple tables and chairs in a basic room with memorabilia-covered walls. The service was great. Super friendly and very attentive. The patrons were, without exception 30-something to elderly men. Not a single female was eating when I sat down for lunch on a Monday. Weird. (And it's not because the waitresses are knock-outs like some kind of Hooters or something. They're just regular women. Like I said, weird.)But that's where the good really ends.I admit, my expectations were high but this really was a super disappointing experience. The ribs were crazy dry, tough, and barely flavorful. The chicken was decent but unremarkable. The brisket, again, was decent but barely noticeable. The cole slaw was actually pretty good for my taste-creamy without too much vinegar or sweet. The pinto beans with pico and cheese were adequate. (Honestly, the onion overpowered everything else in the bowl so you barely taste pinto.) The ""mixed vegetables"" really seemed like a dumped-can concoction. (Chunks of bell pepper, canned carrots and canned green beans.) And their one BBQ sauce was not worth the trouble. It looked a bit like Cholula without the heat or flavor.Still, even as unremarkable as it was, I might have given them a three if not for the hair stuck to my table. Not ""a"" hair. Lots of hair. Yeah. That almost made me hurl.At the end of the day, this place gave the impression of a once great BBQ joint that has lost its way and depends on the nostalgia of patrons who remember (and taste) when it was great back in the day.I will not be returning.","alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-housthttps://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston?start=20,Angel G.,"The Heights, Houston, TX",55,56,16,,1/11/15,"I am so disappointed with this place, me and my friend initially went to Gatlin's to find out they had sold out of everything, so she suggested we come here and I completely regret it.

($14+ for most standard dinner plates).He tried to order the 2-meat platter with ribs and sausage, but the waitress informed us that the all the combo platters excluded ribs. If ribs are the draw, this feels like a trivial way to extract more $$$ from customers, but I took the bait and went with the ribs (solo), the potato salad and the baked beans.Since it was my first time and my friend knew the owner (Jerry), he brought out a small sampler of sausage, brisket and chicken. Here's the rub (no pun intended), this is such an easy (and inexpensive) way to ensure that I had a great experience and will write a review on Yelp (my first in quite some time) and tell my friends about this place. Ribs 4.5 of 5: You get approximately 4 ribs on the rib dinner. They're delicious. I love the no frills salt and pepper approach. The key isn't the ingredients, it's the execution -- and these ribs were up to par. I THINK I enjoyed Gatlin's a bit more, but don't let this dissuade you. These are great ribs and I'd recommend them to anyone looking for good BBQ in the Houston area.Sides 3 of 5: I didn't love the mustard potato salad, but it wasn't bad. A little aggressive with the celery. (Aside: The best potato salad belongs to McKenzie's Barbeque in Huntsville, TX). The pinto beans were pretty plain, especially compared to the one's at Gatlin's clearly cooked with bacon, fat and an extra side of love. Next time I'll try them with the pico and cheese.Chicken 4 of 5: Where it lacks in moisture (it wasn't dry, but could've used a twinge more moisture) it made up for with the skin. The skin was fantastic. Good smoky flavor. I preferred it to both the brisket and sausage.Brisket & Sausage 3 of 5: Let's just put these two together because all-in-all they were average. The friend that brought me was a big fan of the link sausage because it lacked grease, but as a result, I thought it lacked punch. The brisket was just a bit too dry and fatty for my tastes. With better sauce I'd devour both.Sauce 2 of 5: Speaking of sauce, I'm not a fan. Unlike the wife, I'm a fan of condiments and I love a good BBQ sauce, but I was pretty overwhelmed by this tomato-based sauce. While I prefer the vinegar based sauces of the Carolina's over the brown-sugar water they typically serve in Texas, this sauce didn't have a hint of sweet to offset the sour. In these instances I need a strong kick and this sauce didn't have that either. It served to moisten the brisket and sausage, but was pretty underwhelming.Banana Pudding 3.5 of 5: I was relatively full or this might've earned a 4. This is very good banana pudding (the best I've had in Houston), but suffers the fate of my childhood in which my Mom's homemade banana pudding triumphs. The pudding itself is solid, the vanilla wafers provide great crunch and texture, but they're a little heavy on the whipped cream. Despite solid flavor, it's hard to endorse at $4.25 for 6-8 spoonfuls. Service 4.5 of 5: Excluding the fact that Jerry brought out a small sampler of meat for my first Pizzitola's experience, the service was friendly and fast without being overbearing. You can't ask for much more from a casual spot.Overall: I still think it's pretty expensive for BBQ, but I highly recommend stopping in for a plate of ribs and chicken. Maybe try the coleslaw with the pinto beans featuring pico and cheese as sides. I'll be back (and take friends) simply because Jerry took the time and effort to enhance my experience by stopping by with a few extra meats. For BBQ in the Heights, I still favor Gatlin's, but if it's later in the afternoon (after Gatlin's starts running out of ribs - and other meats - I highly recommend giving Pizzitola's a try for good barbecue and great service!","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-housthttps://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston?start=20,Joe L.,"Missouri City, TX",0,27,7,,1/2/16,"Before I start I want to say that this is not meant to be malicious, just my account as I remember it. Just to lay down a little bit of info about myself, when it comes to bbq I am not a self appointed pit master. I do know a little something about bbq and have been studying on how to perfect my brisket. I have had bbq in a few spots around houston as well as bbq row in Lockhart.With all that said after eating at Pizzitola's I think we as Houstonians need to reevaluate what we consider good bbq. Today 1/2/16, a buddy and I went to Pizzitola's after another place we were going to try wasn't open yet for the new year. When we entered there was no one there but the staff, then another couple entered and sat behind us. Now the waitstaff and the gentleman the appeared to be Mr. Pizzitola were all nice and hospitable; he even gave us samples after we told him it was our first time there. After we sampled the ribs that Mr. Pizzitola brought us, he asked "" makes you want to come back huh?"" At that point, I felt as this was about to be someone selling me bbq instead of it selling itself. I'll get back to this. So we reluctantly ordered the sampler which came with 1/2 pound of ribs and two other meats for 23-24 dollars and if you want a round of three sides it would be another 8 dollars. So we both got the sampler and sides. Now this is where it goes down hill. Our plates come and I look at at the meat plate, man this looks old. My buddy can cook ribs well enough to where you want to hurt someone to get another one so I know what a good rib looks and tastes like and these were neither. I am not a professional chef, but I have cooked under a couple, today on 1/2/16 I think I was served old food. If you have ever sliced into a perfectly cooked slab of ribs, after they have rested the meat of the rib is a vibrant whitish-pinkish from the smoke color. The ribs I had today were burgundy on the tops and bottoms which was nice but also on the sides they had that weird color that your leftovers get when you set them in the microwave to come back to later. The brisket was the exact same way. Not only did it taste like nothing it was dry. There was that thin white line you get from beef when it's overcooked. Again I am only on my fourth or fifth brisket that I have done in my life but when I pull mine at 205 and let them rest they have NEVER been ""leave your mouth with no saliva"" dry. Mr. Pizzitola suggested that we try the bbq without the sauce, I quickly drowned my plate in sauce cause that was the only way to get it down. The sausage, unless you make them yourself I can careless about and those seem like some brand that he buys so I won't review it. As far as the sides go, I am going to spend as much time on them as Pizzitola's did. Coleslaw: bagged barely dressed if at all with no seasoning, potato salad: maybe store bought maybe not regardless it was the best thing that I ate, pintos: minimal seasoning if any; nothing to write home about. To give credit where it's due, I think Pizzitola's ribs were perfectly cooked and would have been good had they not been old, and over salted.Now back to the question that Mr. Pizzitola asked me about coming back? No. I think the demographic of people that frequent your restaurant probably are grillers, if they cook, more than they are slow and low smokers. So to understand you have to know what the end result should have been and this was not it. At least not what I had today. Today 1/2/16, what $84 including tip afforded us was leftovers probably from before the new year. Unless his employees came into work on New Year's Day at 7pm to 11pm to start those briskets, then the food I ate today was old. It's really hard to believe that it wasn't leftovers from before the new year when I asked the waitstaff if they were open New Year's Day and they said that they were not. So when did you start cooking for today's lunch when brisket takes from 12 - 16 hours to smoke? So when you ask if your ribs will want me to come back I prefer that the ribs demand that I come back. I have never spoken a word to Ronnie Killen but I have stood in the rain for his bbq. Good Texas bbq. Pizzitola's reputation to me is a mystery, wrapped in and enigma, wrapped in foil and served the next day. ""There's an old saying in Tennessee -- I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee -- that says, fool me once, shame on -- shame on you.

I had a GF visiting Houston for the first time ever and was in search of beef ribs. I called Pizzitola's (among many others) and only Josh very kindly told me they did not have any and referred me elsewhere, saying ""but when you want pork ribs, come see us!"". In this day and age, I was impressed at the humble and gracious referral. So we went to Pizzitola's on a Friday night (2/6/15) and between two dainty flower ladies, demolished a slab of ribs. We had a side of beans and cole slaw and even though they were delicious, we just wanted the meat. We thought the rub was an exotic blend and were surprised to be told the secret. (I won't spoil it for ya'). Husband had the brisket which was fabulous. Betty gave us a sample of the sausage which we all loved. But IMHO, the ribs were the best.My GF had a Lone Star (when in Texas!!) and was given a coozie from a wedding that was held there. How cool was that? There are many stories in there, I hope you get to chat with Josh or Jerry or Betty and be entertained.I disagree with the naysayers here but everyone has their own tastes and opinions.

I asked her to put the chopped beef on the side and she told me that there would be an extra charge for that. I have ordered this from several other barbeque restaurants, and never had this issue. I thought that maybe I was paying for the plastic container or something. When I asked how much more it would be, she said it would cost $8.00 more. I said ""you're kidding, why"" she said it was because if you order the chopped beef on the side, they give you a pound of chopped beef. I told her that all I wanted was what would come on the baked potato. She said if I ordered the chopped beef on the potato, it would be $10.95, but if I requested to have the chopped beef on the side, it would be $8.00 extra.

I have never been happier to find the fault in my speculations. When we walked in, we noticed mainly business people sitting and happily chowing on plates of grilled meats. The place was pretty crowded close to the side door, but plenty of room was available near the other side of the restaurant. The host told us to find a place where we would like to sit after inquiring if it was our first time there. (Was it our clueless expressions that gave us away?) Mum and I took a seat, and started to browse the (thankfully) short menu, while examining the plentiful pictures and papers on the walls. We ordered our beverages, and the waitress asked if this was our first time at the restaurant. (I think we took to long perusing the menu this time...) While we continued deciding, a gentleman randomly took a seat at our table, and offered advice on what to order. He claimed he did not work for the restaurant, but I am not too sure about that. THEN the owner of the restaurant came over a few minutes later, and talked to mum while I ordered the sampler platter (ribs, sausage, and beef [brisket]) and some sides (pinto beans, potato salad, coleslaw). The owner mentioned to us the cuts of the brisket, and after asking what parts we liked best and if we had ordered the chicken, he went back to the kitchen to make our order more specific. Our waitress came back with two plates of warm wet towels (to clean our hands! so great!), as well as housemade BBQ sauce and white bread. Soon our food arrived. We were even given some chicken to try! The grilled meat portions were greatly generous. The sausage (from a Czech place in Texas) was delicious, the brisket was perfectly grilled and juicy, the ribs fell of the bone, and the chicken was perfectly seasoned without excess fat. The BBQ sauce was not even necessary. We were so impressed. Unfortunately the sides were not that great. (Total was $29.55) While we ate, we were even given a story of the restaurant, and the people who worked there (most people there have been with the restaurant for YEARS). We will definitely be returning for more grilled meats, and next time we will skip the sides.

That's the headline for Pizzitola's. Met the owner and they were so kind to walk me back to show me the last brick pits in operation in Houston. An oasis in a pit desert. People drive out of town to get this kind of barbecue.I scored Pizzitolas an 88 out of 100. This is Reserve Grand Champion Texas Barbecue. Border line Grand Champion. If the ribs had been more tender the score would easily gone over 90.Smoke: Hickory. Real Brick pits. I spotted the smoke billing out of the stacks and was encouraged. Spotted the brick pits at the counter, and asked if they were still in operation. They proudly told me they are the last ones in Houston. For that alone they should get 5 star status.Brisket: Excellent. 1/4in smoke ring. Snap apart tender, no knife needed. Rich crunchy black bark. A great black peppery rub that keep you licking your lips. Good smoke flavor. It will take a few days before this brisket leaves my memory. No sauce needed.Ribs: Good. A little tough of Tender with little tearing and slight dirty bone. Great peppery rub, good bark and good smoke flavor. These are really good ribs and no sauce is needed.Sausage: Very Good. A traditional pork/beef course ground sausage with strong traditional spice and great peppery after taste. Little grease. No sauce needed.Sauce: Good. Tomato soupy based with strong lemon, butter and vinegar flavors. By itself its OK but it does the job its intended for and gives every bite a nice flavor boost.The owner was so kind to offer me a sample of chicken, its not part of my score but worth review. It also has a nice peppery rub, good smoke, a little dry. No sauce needed. I don't consider chicken traditional Texas BBQ but its always good business to have something on the menu for the womenfolk.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-housthttps://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston?start=40,Seth P.,"Houston, TX",16,12,,,4/24/15,"Delicious!

Easily one of the best of i've ever had, and i've had a lot. They say it's the only open pit BBQ house left in Houston, and while I don't know all the history and/or science behind that, I know that the brisket is a cut above the competition, at least in the Houston area. The sauce takes some getting used to; by itself it is nothing special but when applied to any of the meats, it enchances the flavor and moisture without overpowering the natural flavors already present. I wasn't in love with the sauce in the beginning but in hindsight I realize how finely-tuned it truly was. Prices are a little steep here, but if you think about it, unless it is a big chain type place, you're hard pressed to find cheap BBQ anywhere these days, especially in the urban areas. This place pretty much puts all the crap back in Philadelphia to shame. I'll be back here for sure. The pork ribs and most of the sides are all top notch in addition to the brisket.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-housthttps://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston?start=60,Andrew S.,"Houston, TX",4,9,5,,12/10/13,"The food is amazing and it's one of the few real places in Houston.

So I jumped on yelp here and started looking. Found Pizzitolas in the search and it matched up with where my co-worker thought she saw a usually packed place.We arrived soon after they opened and the smell of smokey BBQ hits you right when you get out of your car. The wind was blowing away from us and we could still smell the sweet aroma of the BBQ pit. There were plenty of tables available, we had the pick of where we wanted to sit. About 11:45 the pickings were very slim for tables so if you are heading out for lunch try to get there about 11:30 I would say for a good choice of seats. The waitstaff was welcoming and right there when you needed something but not really hovering. At least two were always out in the ""main isle"" I guess you would call it from the front door to the dessert case / opening to the kitchen. If they saw you looking around magically your waitress arrived seconds later to check on you. So maybe hovering without the overbearing of hovering. Or some would call it timed just right service.My co-worker and I split the sampler platter and two sides. It was enough to get us content without being stuffed. Remember I am eating with a female here so if its two big guys going in to eat go ahead and spring for a sampler each if you are big eaters. All the food was at least ok, but let me break it down for you.The meats, Oh the meats. I am not a big fan of ribs in general, I don't like to fight my food I just like to eat it so I am a once in a blue moon rib type. Well I can say this place has me saying ...WHEN ARE WE GETTING THESE AGAIN!!!!The ribs were awesome. Pretty much fell off the bone, not too much fat to fight around, flavorful but not over powering, all around converted a non-fan great. You could tell that there was a simple seasoning on the rib but it wasn't a reach out and grab you by the shirt collar and smack you in the face type. Just a nice mellow compliment to the meat. And you could still taste the meat which was nice and juicy but not greasy. The one end of two of the shorter ribs were a little tough and probably over done but still had a nice flavor and a little moistness to it. That part was the only part that I could find that benefited from the sauce for something other than complimentary flavor.In the sampler we picked Brisket and Links as the other two meats and I have to say they were excellent as well. The brisket was very lean but still moist enough that you didn't have to put BBQ Sauce on it to be able to eat it. It had a very nice smokey flavor and with the sauce it was even better. The Links were a little spicy to start off but again not an over bearing spice note just one that says ""yup I am here and ready to wake up your tastebuds"" but not one that is going to send your heartburn flaring unless you are really sensitive to spicy things.The BBQ Sauce was on the thinner side but still had some substance to it. You can certainly taste the tomato base of it but it had enough tang to say it was there and compliment the meats but not get overbearing and drown out the flavors of the different meats. If you are a fan of really spicy thin BBQ sauce there is a place in Alabama that I could send you too that has fire water for sauce, but thats not my thing. I like a nice complementary sauce that still has a little ""Hello I am here to spice you up without being obnoxious"" kind of a note to it. And for that Pizzitolas delivers.The sides were nothing to write home about and half the reason that I didn't give them 5 stars. The portions were very small for the price and a little on the bland side. I wasn't impressed by the coleslaw and my co-worker was not happy with her potato salad in either size nor taste. Both looked like they were from a bulk food type tub that you would get at a wholesale food place by the 5 gallon pail. Mine tasted good, but it wasn't flavorful by any means. I didn't try my co-workers potato salad but she said it was mustard and potato with little else. The other reason I couldn't give them 5 stars were the drinks. That much for a CAN of coke really? I guess I am going to have to start liking tea or drinking a lot more lemonade.We will be going back for the Ribs and Brisket again but probably not the sides. And we will have to watch the news the next few nights as we think channel 13 was in there filming for something. I didn't see any markings on the camera but my co-worker caught a glimpse of the badge the camera guy was wearing and said it looked like the channel 13 logo. So check out the news the next few nights and we might be famous in the background.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-housthttps://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston?start=80,O B.,"Houston, TX",35,109,27,,8/28/14,Friendly staff and great customer service!

Live music in a bbq restaurant on a Thursday night was a surprise, and the two guys and a girl playing country/folk tunes were pretty good. The servers were more than welcoming, admitting they'd seen quite a number of groupons, having sold 2000 of them.We both got brisket plates (ribs seem to be their specialty, but I prefer brisket). I got a generous portion of meat that was tasty and moist, with sauce that was pleasant but could have been a little spicier. The potato salad was just ok; the cole slaw and the beans, which David got, were the better choices. Since we had the coupon, we splurged on dessert. My pecan pie was good and David said his pineapple coconut cake was great.At something like $13.25 for a brisket dinner, it wasn't cheap.

Coming from the Hill Country, I've already had the best the state has to offer, so I generally expect average BBQ once I'm inside the city limits. Having driven by Pizzitola's countless times, always with a packed parking lot, I thought it would be a great place to have lunch. And, Wow. Just, Wow. Food wise, this is great BBQ. The ribs are amazing: incredibly well seasoned, lots of meat, perfectly smoked. The chicken was tender, the brisket was sweet and smoky and moist and amazing. The potato salad was not to my liking, but the beans with pico and cheddar were some of the best I've ever had. It's a very tomato based sauce, without as much sweetness or molasses as many Texas BBQ places, but the flavor is great, and it never overwhelms the meat. Some places allow their meat to suffer at the hands of their sauce. This place keeps the focus where it should be, on the BBQ. Now, the best part of this restaurant...Mr. Pizzitola. I mean, seriously?!? Is this man real? My boyfriend was late for lunch and he sat with me for 10 minutes talking BBQ, getting my opinions, offering suggestions, and generally making me feel like I was sitting at my dining room table. I have never felt so welcome or taken care of in a restaurant I'd never been to before. He checked in with us through the course of the meal, brought some samples since it was our first time, and made sure that we were taken care of. When was the last time you ate somewhere with an owner who was personally invested in the experience of each and every diner?

The service is outstanding and most of the staff has been there for years. The ambiance is great too...it's a truly historic place in Houston and the smell that comes from those brick pits (the only bbq restaurant left in Houston to still have and use these) will make your mouth water the second you walk through the door. Over the past few months of visiting here, I have learned that it is a family owned business and the owner has given me complimentary sampler plates just for bringing in new customers because he understands customer service and is an all-around great guy!But let's focus on the most important part...the food. The ribs. Oh my gosh, the ribs. I've never liked ordering ribs from BBQ restaurants because they are never as good as my dad's out of his homemade smoker in the backyard. These are not just as good, they are better. I brought my dad immediately after discovering these gems, and he agreed that he has never had better ribs. They aren't the kind that just fall off the bone, which some people prefer, but the kind that you have to lick every piece of delicious meat off the bone, my favorite way to eat ribs. I was shocked to discover that they only use salt and pepper to season their ribs. That's how great the brick pit is. It brings so much flavor to the meat and it's incredible. I could eat them with or without barbecue sauce and be more than satisfied. That's not to say I don't love the sauce....their sauce is absolute perfection. I hate going to bbq joints that just drown the sauce in brown sugar...I don't want my lunch to be like dessert! Their sauce is a perfect blend of the sweet and sour aspects of your typical barbecue sauce with a consistency that coats the ribs or any of their meats in just the right way. I always recommend getting the sampler plate if it's your first time so you can try a little bit of everything...the chicken is amazing and never too dry like many other bbq places I've tried, I love their sausage links, and their brisket is always one of my favorites. If you want to try a sandwich, the link and beef is my go-to with sausage and brisket on an onion bun but the chopped beef is killer too. And you can't forget about the sides...I love their potato salad and that is saying a lot because I rarely like potato salad unless it has bacon in it. I usually order a side of that and a side of beans with cheese and pico...you must get the cheese and pico because the combo is amazing. I'm usually too full for dessert and I have a weird hatred for bananas but I've been told the banana pudding is one of the best you will ever have, and it's an old family recipe so it makes it that much better.I have lived in Houston or the suburbs of Houston my entire life and never knew of Pizzitola's until last year.

I love pulled pork, so I just blanked and asked our waitress to pick for me, and I ended up with the sliced beef and chicken mixed meat plate. Aaaaand, the sliced beef was my second caveat. It had a really awesome flavor, but it was ridiculously dry, so to eat it I had to pile on the barbecue sauce. The sauce also had a great flavor, but I liked the beef's flavor better. The chicken, though, was out of this world. It was so favorful and moist.We also had the ribs to start off, with everyone getting two ribs. Honestly, they were moist and flavorful with a great spicy rub. Again, the barbecue sauce was great, but I couldn't figure out which way I liked it more.For sides I did the pinto beans, which were awesome, and the grilled vegetables which were AMAZING. It included grilled tomato, how awesome is that? And all nicely salted and peppered, really flavorful. My husband said that the potato salad was great, but it was mustard based, which i just will not have.Service was quick and friendly, and the place was nearly empty. There were about 15 of us that came in at once in our ridiculously large extended family group, and they didn't even bat an eye at it.

After I hightailed it to visit San Jacinto then shot over to Saint Arnold Brewery for a tour. Nice little day trip in the books. My first spot of the day was Vergie's (and I'll get to that later) and this was my second. I would've loved to hit up Gatlin's but I made an executive decision based on a couple reasons. First, they've been around since 1935 and have an open pit. Second, it was on my way to San Jacinto. Thirdly, I wanted to try the famous ribs. I'd say that's pretty reasonable thinking. This place was packed and even though it was I still was given very nice treatment as a customer. I sat down and ordered the three meat sampler plate. Nothing else. Atkin's diet only on this beautiful Houston day. Wanting to see what all the hype was about I immediately grabbed a rib. My Lord this bite was perfect. With a wonderful mix of salt and pepper the rub needed no other seasonings or base. They may use something else but I was too busy cleaning the meat off the bone. One may have thought I had some bath salts running through my system. It wasn't a pretty sight. My only hiccup was some Membrane still resided on them. Next up to plate...the link. Unfortunately it was served cut therefore I didn't have the ability to snap it. It was spicy and very good though I'd like to have more smoke with it. Next up was the brisket...unfortunately served chopped and non-fatty. This was before I decided that I should always go for fatty because the enhanced juice and flavors. Plus not a fan of chopped style. My mistake. Unfortunately this taste much like pot roast. It was a bit dry too. After having stellar brisket at Vergie's...this was a let down. All in all...I would love to return in hopes the brisket would be what I want it to be for a fourth star.

It's hard not to like this place on those merits alone.As others have mentioned, ribs are definitely their specialty - beef spareribs, which at a lot of joints tend to be dry and not-so-meaty (Pappa's BBQ, I'm looking at you). Pizzitola's had a rack-of-ribs special going on, and boy did we need that whole rack - although they were a bit salty for my taste, they were also darned tender and delicious, to the point of being addictive. The brisket was okay but less impressive overall; the chicken (another oft-neglected meat at other places) and the spicy sausage, however, were very well prepared and flavorful. The potato salad is bland - more of a carb-y blank canvas, but the pinto beans and grilled veggies fared much better. The desserts (we tried the banana pudding and coconut-pineapple cake) definitely had that homemade feel, in the best way possible. Also, service was surprisingly fast.Why 5 stars? This is by far my favorite BBQ joint in Houston proper.

My reviews are honest and I've only ever reviewed 3 things so far. I like to warn people when I think something is bad and this bbq was honestly NOT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE A PALETTE!! This is the WORST BBQ we've EVER had. We LOVE BBQ and we've eaten BBQ all over our great country from the amazing in Kansas City to the equally amazing bbq in a decrepit pink shack in Austin, TX We're not snobs when it comes to the look of a place, we even don't care much about the service so long as the BBQ is great! And holy cow this place is bad. It's so bad that I can't believe how many people have given it a good review. The ""Cole slaw"" was disgusting, dry, old tasteless chopped cabbage bits. We returned it only to get major attitude and no refund for it, they agreed to replace it with a different side so we got their pinto bean disaster which was equally tasteless and a total let down. Let me tell you about the chopped beef sandwich, which we the worst I've ever had. The sauce was more like an Italian tomato sauce than a BBQ sauce. The sauce would be better suited to spaghetti. The meat was smothered in this gross tomato sauce and from what I was able to discern the meat was also a tasteless wonder. This experience actually made me angry. I hate wasting good money on bad food and after trying to return the disgusting Cole slaw, we realized that the establishment would not give us a refund for our food so we forced ourselves to eat it...in retrospect, we should have and just walked out and let them keep their crappy food, crappy service and our money. It was one of the absolute worst dining experiences of our lives.Dear YELP: I edited my review because for some reason you ""filtered"" my review. I removed all the names of great places to actually go and eat BBQ because perhaps that's why my review was ""filtered"".

The ribs were well-spiced, not too hot (pepper-wise) and definitely flavorful. However, a few were fatty and hard to chew. The sausage was average. The sauce had a ketchup-like consistency and just as tangy and sweet. I wasn't a fan of the potato salad as it didn't taste as though it was made in-house. The coleslaw was tasty and enjoyable.Curious about the chopped beef sandwich, I tasted a piece from my dining companion's plate.

So I took my old boss and gave it a try. So here's my take on it.Mr. Jerry Pizzitola himself greeted us as we walked to our table. This, to me, should give you an idea of the atmosphere. I ordered a beef sandwich --don't judge me, I just wanted the brisket! My boss ordered a beef and sausage plate. Jerry came by again to ask if we'd been here before and when we told him no he asked what we'd ordered. Shaking his head at me in disbelief, he told me to be prepared. He said, ""The sauce always comes on the side."" Now I know why! The meat was delicious. To add to that, he came back out to our table and put down a plate of a few sausage slices and 2 ribs. He said he wanted my boss to try at least one rib, and the other rib and sausage was for me. And let me tell you, I'm going back for all three next time! The ribs were perfectly seasoned and fell right off the bone. I hesitated to even put bbq sauce on it! I've read that some people think the bbq sauce is ""weak."" Well then I guess they're only satisfied with Kraft's BOLD & SPICY processed bbq sauce because Pizzitola's sauce hit the spot. Not greasy. Not salty. Just a slight kick and just enough flavor but more than enough to make a repeat customer out of me. One more thing, Jerry invited us to the back to actually see the antique brick pit and let me tell ya, I've never seen anything like it, and no wonder I've never tasted anything like it! Try it. And make sure you try the ribs! I know it sounds messy (ladies) but the meat falls off the bone.

My sister and I are always delighted to miss the crowds. We decided to sample a bit, so we started with some ribs.I don't know if they're like this all the time, but I thought the ribs were way too salty. I kind of blame the saltiness for making them as dry as they were. It's a shame. I was hoping for better.

The place was near empty most of the night, but it's supposedly quite busy at lunch time. Despite the nonexistent crowd, I was very excited about dinner based on the amazing smells wafting from the kitchen. As others have said, the walls are covered with random memorabilia. There's also an antique-looking bar at the end of the restaurant that's very cool, but I doubt it gets much use. It felt like sitting in a large double-wide with cafeteria style lighting, tables, chairs, and tableware. Who really cares though? Nobody goes to barbecue joints for ambiance. Service was incredibly friendly throughout our meal, and most of our group started things off with bottles of St. Arnold's, Miller Light, or Heineken. The husband and I shared a 1/2 pound of brisket and a 1/2 pound of ribs, plus a double serving of potato salad. Fluffy white bread, pickles, onions, and pickled jalapenos (jalapenos are an extra .40 per pepper) were brought out to accompany everyone's meals, plus mini pitchers of tasty barbecue sauce were scattered about the table. Most of the meal was just good, but the ribs were extra special. They were heavily seasoned with a dry rub and while the meat didn't fall right off the bone, they were exceptionally tasty. I was also a big fan of the barbecue sauce. It had a great kick to it with just a hint of sweetness. For dessert, the hubby had banana pudding and I tried the much raved about coconut cake.

I had a day off from work and the BF decides he wants BBQ for lunch. He likes to give new places we haven't been a chance (good thing), so he found Pizzitola's on Yelp and off we went. I really need to get in the habit of taking pictures of places/food, why I must always be starving and forget is beyond me. If you do attempt this place on a weekday lunch adventure, the parking is a little tricky because it is Restaurant Land at Shepherd and I-10, seriously there are about 10 restaurants all crammed into about 4 blocks. Once you are inside, you have now entered Houston, TX in 1987. The walls are wood paneled, all of the decorations have been there since it probably opened! Pretty nostalgic, definitely felt like I traveled back in time. Let it be known that these people are very proud of their ribs. My BF got the rib plate, which came with three ribs (small!) and chicken and brisket (you could have chosen pork as well instead of chicken or beef, but as other reviewers have mentioned - they are consistently out of pork, very strange). His plate was $18.95 and that is all he was served, just the meat for $19! I ordered the ""ladies special"" (no jokes please) for $11.50 and I thought that was a pretty good deal, I ordered sausage and lean brisket. The sauce really saves this place, it is spicy and has a good kick to it. The sides are passable, the cole slaw I received was cabbage and mayo, that's it, and the potato salad had huge chunks of celery in it, which I do not mind celery, just not large chunks of it in my potato salad. The ribs were indeed good, the BF is very picky and declared these to be of good quality, however he went on to say that they were not good enough to come back and order a rib plate, and that maybe getting the ribs to go by the pound was the way to go. Besides the food, the waitstaff were very friendly, felt like you were dining at a relatives house or something, everyone was very accommodating and felt like they would go out of their way to get us whatever we needed, that was a definite plus.

It will totally knock your socks off if this is the ""barbecue"" that you are used to.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-housthttps://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston?start=140,Marc C.,"Lafayette, CA",2,15,,,8/23/09,"This is an old school, country-style BBQ joint. The waitresses are extremely friendly and attentive. If you like that type of atmosphere, then you will feel right at home at Pizzitola's. I had the two-meat combo dinner including (2) ribs, sausage link, beans and potato salad. The quantity of food was slightly disappointing, but then again I have a ""healthy"" appetite. The ribs had a decent spice to them but lacked meat. I found the sausage to be tasty (especially with the sauce), but not hot. The beans were bland and I wouldn't get them again. One bright spot was the potato salad. I know that tastes vary, but for me, the potato salad was delish!I wouldn't make a special trip to eat there, but if I were in the area, I might stop back by.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston,pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-housthttps://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzitolas-bar-b-cue-houston?start=140,David S.,"Atlanta, GA",29,122,,,6/16/08,"The best ribs in Houston.

The food is not worth the money. It's way over price for what you get. If you want to suck on bones when you order ribs that's all you're going to get... BONES! The rib was DRY! I have eaten way better sausages from the supermarket... even when I throw it in the microwave instead of the BBQ pit!
