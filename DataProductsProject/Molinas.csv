The bartender/waitress is Stephanie and she is always wonderful and on point. This past week I went in with my girl, best friend and a couple of neighbors. The wait service was very good as usual however the kitchen totally botched my girl and my order. Forgot the appetizer and our dinners were missing the toppings and some of the other items. We told Stephanie and she went and got the manager.The manager is Joseph, and I can not say enough ggod things about this gentleman. He was apologetic, cordial and very professional. He took care of the issue brought she and I a couple more drinks and then gave a discount on the meal.

The parking lot was full and only valet was available. We didn't have cash on us so we ended up parking across the street. We were welcomed and seated right away. The restaurant seems pretty big and well staffed so there was never a wait and we had multiple people waiting on us. Our drink orders were taken promptly and the margaritas were brought out fast. They gave us complimentary chips and salsa and we ordered a small queso too but it ended up coming out with the rest of the meal which was slightly inconvenient. I think my bf got the Molina's plate (or something along those lines) and I got the vegetable quesadillas. One plate of his food came out considerably earlier than the rest of the stuff and we were slightly confused on what it was. It appeared to be two taco shells under a large bed of lettuce with a queso-dipped chip next to it. About 15 min later his second plate of beans, rice, meat, etc came out along with my quesadillas. We still aren't too sure what the first plate was and why it was so early but either way the food tasted rather good. The quesadillas were actually meant as an appetizer but were filling enough as an entree. They had squash inside which was new and interesting! Overall impression: Through the evening we probably saw four different servers helping us and never waited for a refill or anything. Food was quick. Decor is cute. Place is fairly priced. Drinks, queso, and two meals plus tip for around $50 - not bad.

We continued to return over the years because of the fabulous service and strong margaritas brought out to us on the patio by our favorite server, Leydi. Sometime this year management changed. Things quickly went downhill. Soon, there were strangers asking me what I wanted to drink, instead of quickly bringing me a frozen margarita with salt within seconds of sitting down like Leydi would always do. Besides having to order at a restaurant I visit at least once a week and get the same thing every time, the new servers were not nearly as friendly nor endearing as Leydi is. We tolerated the new server schedule for two reasons: first, the margaritas were still on point. And secondly, we would still sometimes see the smiling face of our favorite server when she was allowed to work on the patio. Recently we visited and the margaritas were terrible -- first time ever experiencing this. The table of regulars that sits next to us noticed it as well--that's why I saw them drinking beer for the first time ever.No Leydi on the patio, no good margaritas... What is the point of even going anymore? I decided to give it one more shot. On my most recent visit last week, I was informed that Molina's Cantina let Leydi go. She had provided the Molina family restaurant with about 20 years of service. That was the last straw. I will never step foot inside Molina's Cantina ever again after they way they treated their regulars and their best server. I encourage all of you to stay away. Rumor has it that Leydi can be found at another nice Mexican place on Durham.

We had a combination of two waiters/waitresses so it was hard to tell who was serving us.

Well it is probably tied with the Negra Modelo I was drinking for the highlight of the dinner. I then had the Tacos ala Molinas or something like that.

You see, I have been a Molina's addict ever since,well forever. The Margaritas that packed a wallop, the chili gravy that was unparalleled and the friendly, welcoming service that made you feel at home, or better. Then once upon a time, Molinas opened their Bellaire location (after the Buffalo speedway closure) and everything fell apart at Washington. It's like once they opened in Bellaire, they raped and pillaged the Washington location. They took the best waitstaff (actually they took most of the waitstaff) and the management is practically nonexistent but the management that remained is incompetent and rude.So the straw that broke the camels back? Husband Bruce and I went Sunday night for our Sunday Mexican food ritual. Place was nearly empty. Ordered frozen Margaritas which were completely melted. Waitpersongoes MIA after delivery of these messes and is nowhere to be found. We return Margaritas to the bar ourselves in exchange for FROZEN Margaritas which we are given. Bruce orders 2nd Margarita midway through meal and same issue. Margarita Meltdown. Tells waitress, she says she will talk to manager. Manager (who has been scarce all night) comes over and accuses us of trying to return the same Margarita we ordered earlier. (and why should we have to explain ourselves anyway?) We tried to explain this was round 2. He was rude and abrasive but agreed to bring Bruce another. By that point we had lost the desire to stick around and just told waitress to bring the check. To their credit they comped the drinks but we weren't even expecting or wanting this. We did expect to be treated like good customers in a place where there appears to be a shortage of any customers.Mind you, we have been patronizing Molinas for 13 years. Both the Buffalo speedway location and then the Washington location. We were familiar faces in this restaurant. We were willing to put up with the valet parking which I hate, simply because we liked the place.Molinas is going to be off the rotation for now. They need to do better or just shut the doors and be done with it. It almost seems that is the plan because the place is practically dead every time we go. I guess it's El Tiempo, Los Tios and El Patio (Club No) from here on.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,molinas-cantina-houston-3,molinas-cantina-houston-3https://www.yelp.com/biz/molinas-cantina-houston-3?start=40,Travis F.,"Houston, TX",19,18,4,,5/8/14,"I don't know why anyone would bother going here with how many better options there are within blocks.

When I pulled up, there were empty spots in the parking lot, but they all had cones in front of them. I looked around and finally saw a valet so decided to do as the Houstonians do and valet my rental car. I pulled up to the valet guy's little ""stand"" and proceeded to get out of the car. He then asked me if I was going to Max's Wine Dive. I said no, I was going to Molina's. He then informed me that he only valet's for Max's and I needed to use their valet. Excuse me? Who has valet in a shopping center anyways????? That's the most pompous, ridiculous, money squeezing venture I've ever heard of. So I asked the guy where the other valet was and he proceeded to point to nothing. I mean nothing, no one was there! So I hopped back in the Jeep and decided to find my own spot and was not going to give Molina's valet (if I ever found him) the pleasure of a tip - eventhough I had an expense account. I found a parking spot on one of the side streets and walked to the restaurant.... still no valet to be seen.My party was already seated when I finally got in there. I ordered a margarita (rocks with salt) and the bean burritos. Margaritas were ok, but I've had better and the burritos were decent - full of beans and loaded with cheese on top (who doesn't like cheese!)I think I'll find another place to eat Tex-Mex in the Heights.Oh, Molina's... ditch the valet thing. It's annoying.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,molinas-cantina-houston-3,molinas-cantina-houston-3https://www.yelp.com/biz/molinas-cantina-houston-3?start=120,Ellie M.,"Brighton, CO",5,7,,,7/20/10,"This past weekend Zach and I felt like going out and getting some Mexican food in the city. I wanted to find something with good food and an even better atmosphere (for all you Californians out there--think Chevys Fresh Mex) that wasn't so traditional, so a cantina sounded like the way to go. We got to the restaurant around 7pm and it was packed inside. Thankfully, we were able to be seated immediately on the covered patio which was kept nice and cool by a few misters. I definitely liked the patio because it was quieter and more relaxed, which is exactly what we were looking for. Honestly, about 80% of the time, the main reason I want to go to a Mexican restaurant is because of the chips and salsa. Who doesn't like chowing down on a free, fatty appetizer that is bottomless? Exactly. Molina's has a phenomenal salsa, in my opinion, and needless to say I went through more chips and salsa than my significant other. We went with the queso as well, which was a little disappointing but nothing to complain about. For a meal I chose something on the lighter side (after tasting the salsa, you probably will too!): the chalupas. Boy were they good! One beef and one chicken was the perfect amount of food, though if you're the kind of person who likes sides I'd stick to a full dinner plate. Zach ordered the Deluxe Dinner which included a beef taco, cheese enchilada, bean tostada, a tamale, and rice and beans to boot. Talk about a LOT of food! He enjoyed it as well--though there was something odd about the ""cheese enchilada"" which was made from the above mentioned queso. What also stood out for me was the exceptional service, from the waiter to the woman who refilled our drinks before we could drink more than half a glass. Also, by the end of our dinner it started pouring (flash flood status) and the restaurant loaned us one of their umbrellas so that we could stay somewhat dry walking back to the car. Overall a very good experience.

The Jose's dip is what makes this place. The tacos are also really good and the fajitas are notable but not compared to El Tiempo's. If you are looking for the manliest and close to the most unhealthy meal, order two tacos al carbon (chicken or beef), rice and beans. Make sure you get the tacos al carbon smothered in Jose's dip.

The Creamy Sopa Poblana soup on the other hand, is very VERY good (I am quite biased to any corn chowder type soup) and comes in a large bowl. Even though the bowl filled to about 70%, it is such a big bowl that the amount given is more than any other place I can think of. I also had the carnitas lunch special.
