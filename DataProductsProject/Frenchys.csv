However I'm just like .... whatever! Anywho, I got to try Frenchys for the first time during Super Bowl weekend. So you know the lines were insane. My companions and I opted to go inside because the drive thru line did not look as if it was moving any time soon. The menu was so overwhelming I just could not decide on what to order. That is when the person taking my order informed me to I guess get the original with chicken and fries even though I was sad it didn't come with the biscuit smh. (Oh oh oh apparently the sweet tea isn't all that so Texas just CANNOT be the south and my thoughts remain the same on it being the Midwest) It only took less than five minutes to receive my other and everything was good. Although I will say I liked my chicken better as leftovers but the fries were yummy with whatever kinda salt they sprinkle on top. I would highly suggest this is be a drunken night too spot though because I just couldn't imagine eating this on a regular sober day. Maybe it's me but it was an heavy meal that my body just couldn't handle.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,frenchys-chicken-houston,frenchys-chicken-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/frenchys-chicken-houston?start=0,travis l.,"Houston, TX",13,111,22,Elite ’17,6/1/17,Frenchy's oh Frenchy's...you're my addiction my fried chicken affliction.

Crowds have been flocking here for ages to enjoy that homemade taste that is associated with Frenchy's. Is it the best chicken you can find?, not by far. For me personally, I think I have dabbled on too many variations of fried chicken. I must say that the ones that are top contenders are definitely the Palestinian and Chinese versions. Frenchy's version is well made but it fails to deliver those punchy flavors that other versions offer. This version reminds me of a home cooked one with no secret recipe to boast. You will definitely enjoy it though! My favorite part of the meal is always the biscuit.

It is definitely one of my go-to places. The boudain has cajun spicy flavors to it, as opposed to all the nasty ones you get from regular grocery stores or even the ones you buy from special events (such as Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo). The chicken, assuming that they cooked it fresh (you do take a chance on that when you do drive through), the taste is fantastic. However, through out the times that I visited there, the experience is not all great. So in this review, I am going to list out some tips that can save you time and grief.1. Don't go on Sunday or busy food hours. The line is just insane, and there is no A/C while you are standing in line. You can rely on your A/C while you are waiting in a drive-through, but even that drive through line is long.2. Always.. I mean.. always open up your box, and check your food before you leave. You may assume that they get your order right, but it only takes just one time to mess up your experience. Case to point (I had two orders of 5 Wings Specials on Sept 2nd 2014 around dinner time. Ticket # 264). Well, we were in a rush so we left without checking. When we got home and started eating, we were in for the surprises. For starter, my friend's 5 Wing Special order has 3 stale fried chicken wings and 2 fresh fried chicken wings. For my 5 Wing Special order, well, I got 3 fresh fried chicken wings + 1 chicken drum stick, and 1 chicken thigh (I have picture to proof that too if the manager ever decides to get in touch with me). So much for a simple and clear 5 Wings Special order.3. The employees are rude when you complain over the phone, so maybe try in the morning when the managers may be present. I called to complain about messed up 5 Wing Special, and the employee simply said that there is nothing she could do until manager is around next morning. 4. If you want to save a buck or two on boudain, you can buy the pre-packaged ones (Frenchy Chicken brand) from the H-E-B (Scott & OST). You can oven bake or BBQ the boudain yourself, and it will come out just as good.5.

The chicken's just slightly salty, but it could be that I am not used to all the spices. I love its crispiness though! I ordered a Creole Sampler costing about $6 - creole sausage, red beans and rice, jambalaya, and an extra side of collard greens (need those veggies!).

The only other chicken I've tasted that can even halfway match Frenchy's is The Breakfast Klub, but if you aren't interested in breakfast or it's closed, definitely this place is where you need to go. It looks like a hole in the wall, honestly, but really...sometimes those are the best places to get REAL food from. The chicken is really...like, I can't even express it's flavorful deliciousness. I'll have dreams in the middle of the night about their chicken, wake up wanting some and then become mildly obsessed with going over there and buying a big order of chicken and fries. I hear this is normal....lol but anyways, and I love Popeyes and KFC (hate Churches....I've given it like 5 chances but everytime I go to a different one, I get sick) but there is a Popeyes like less than a minutes drive down the street and I don't know how they are in business because if I saw Popeyes and Frenchy's right next to eachother and they were about the same price, I would definitely spend my money on some food where people drive all the way from the other side of town (hence ...me!!) to get to!!! I've also tried the red beans and rice and dirty (rice dressing) and they are also really good but nothing beats the fries in my book as a side to heavenly chicken. (rays of light) lol but seriously, it is like the best chicken I've tasted. Now the place, I have said it is kind of a dive...so take it to GO!!! eat it down the street if you can't wait till you get home cuz the smell will fill up your car real quick. If you see fifteen people standing outside to order and you see like five cars in the drive thru, don't let it decieve you...park, get out and wait in line, it will cut your time in half. I've waited in the line thinking it would be quicker because there were fewer people visible to my eyes by the number of cars waiting but it was like a 45 minute wait (and 45 minutes worth of burning gas). Then, a few times, I went ahead and got out, despite the line that I saw and I didn't have more than a 10 to 15 minute wait. Also, don't get too offended if the people who work behind the counter aren't smiling back their with rainbows over their heads...it's hot, they smell grease all day and they can't hear what you're saying because everyone around you is having a lot of conversations. But they are nice, just, they may not go out of their way to find out how your day is going. It's more of a get in, get out situation. They have a few tables to eat there if you really want to, but its right where the line usually is and if you aren't a fan of crowds while you're eating...just take it and leave. But it really is worth it.

But every once in a while, especially after a particularly tough week of training I'll give myself a break and allow myself to eat something that I've been craving. Well today I didn't just off the nutrition boat, I almost drowned myself in vegetable oil when I discovered Fenchy's Fried Chicken. Holy crap the chicken in this place is unbelievable! I ate 9 pieces of fried chicken for lunch. Yeah, you read that right, 9 pieces! The chicken was so ridiculously good I couldn't stop after finishing my 5 piece lunch special so I ordered a 10 piece box to go and ate 4 almost immediately after arriving home. I'm eyeing the remaining 6 pieces as I write this and I just got back from dinner with friends.I can't describe how good it is, you just have to drive there and find out for yourself. Frenchy's sits in a shack of a structure on the west side of UH campus. This is not a good neighborhood by any stretch of the imagination but do not be scared of going here. I'm pretty sure I'm going to be dreaming about fried chicken tonight.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the dirty rice that I had with lunch was only mediocre. Just forget everything else, order the chicken and lots of it. Your cardiologist will hate me for it, but everybody deserves something tasty like this every once in a while, right? Tomorrow I'm back to veggie burgers, tofu and steamed vegetables... god I hate my life...","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,frenchys-chicken-houston,frenchys-chicken-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/frenchys-chicken-houston?start=180,Anna D.,"Austin, TX",0,13,1,,4/26/09,"This place is so good.

I just really wasn't that impressed. I really really wanted to like this place and I had high expectations. It was mediocre, at best. I say it's just slightly better than Church's, but not better than Popeye's or KFC. I do not like fast food chains, so it pains me to prefer one of these options to Frenchy's. It wasn't bad, it was just okay. The chicken had decent flavor, but not as crispy or flavorful as I had been led to believe. The fries were nothing to write home about. The biscuits were sub par. The red beans and rice were completely bland. It was edible, but not satisfying. Definitely not worth the grease and calories. This was not life-altering or awe-inspiring in any way.

My visit to this little place was a great way to top off a University of Houston football victory I was hungry and thirsty and i found the cure. i ordered a 3 piece with fries and a biscuit with a Fanta red to drink. Ok so the chicken was amazing i started with the leg then the thigh then the almighty chicken breast which was F*&$#@^ amazing! The biscuit was great fluffy and buttery, and the fries had a Creo seasoning which pushed them over the top. What confused me was the drink I couldn't figure out if it was flat soda or really sugary Kool-Aid either way it was good :) Now my disappointments there was NO HOT SAUSE there was not a single pack or bottle of hot sauce! And they need to market that Creo seasoning so you can dash it on your chicken when you eat it there. And lastly the service was uh how should i say ""colorful"" if theres a line please know what your gonna order BEFORE you get to the register don't stand in front of the ladies at the register not knowing what to order they will slam the widow in your face and i'm not exaggerating.
