While the last one was excellent, I believe that now the restaurant is even better. Upon arrival, I was offered the choice of tables and was provided exceptional service by everyone, especially Amalia. The lunch menu offers a great selection of delicious choices at reasonable prices. I, of course, ordered the famous fried shrimp and took advantage of the crab ball special offered through Yelp. When I say everything was great, I mean everything. Although I would recommend substituting the French fries. While the onion rings are still excellent, a baked potato would be better than fries. If the fries were fresh cut and fried in only one fryer with peanut oil, who knows what compliments would flow? The current frozen ones simply do not match the caliber of the other items and have a muddled seafood after taste. Aside from this, I highly recommend the restaurant for outstanding seafood, superior service, and a very relaxing atmosphere. Treat yourself or someone special to a wonderful dining experience. What are you waiting for?Christie's and great seafood are bayou city staples. From the front door, you are greeted by friendly staff, a beautiful bar, and a combination of family and subtle mid-century elegance. The dining room is comfortable with reflections of various fishing conquests. As a diner of Christie's for decades I chose to celebrate my parent's 50 th anniversary and my wife's birthday with a quiet dinner at this special place. I was pleasantly surprised by the Yelp Check- in appetizer as well as their participation in the Taste of Houston promotion. Service was good, but not perfect. A tea glass should never go empty and stay empty for more than 10 minutes- especially when it is the great tea served here. But in true fashion, once this was corrected, it never occurred again. The salad with blue cheese dressing was underwhelming. The portion was small and the blue cheese dressing did not contain numerous large chunks of blue cheese as expected. The croutons, however, were fresh and plentiful. The seafood always tastes fresh. We love the fried shrimp. They did not disappoint. The shrimp are always large, succulent, well breaded, and fried to perfection. This is the main reason we have driven 25 miles to Christie's decade after decade. The ""tarter sauce"" is a creamy garlic condiment that defies description. It is delicious all by itself. Whether the fish, shrimp, or crab; we enjoyed them all. A small disappointment was the baked potato. It was different than those in past years. The potato had a soft skin and the fillings were already placed inside. In the past, the potato had a thicker skin and it was wrapped in foil. The fillings were served in a type of rotary stainless buffet as well. All in all, with improvements in a different potato and presentation coupled with more attentive service, Christie's will still maintain a special place in our hearts. This should definitely be a regular monthly or weekly dining experience for you and your family.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,christies-seafood-and-steaks-houston,christies-seafood-and-steahttps://www.yelp.com/biz/christies-seafood-and-steaks-houston?start=0,christies-seafood-and-steaks-houston,Jen S.,"Houston, TX",51,53,404,,6/8/17,"The Salmon Royale was amazing!

Its menu boasts a proud roster of traditional American seafood dishes, including its signature fried shrimp. Despite of its distance from Galveston, the restaurant decor will make you feel as if you are dining by the Bay! The southern hospitality and the attentive service from the waiting staff will make you feel at home.Unfortunately, Christie's food was bland in flavor and unimpressive in presentation. Christie's signature fried shrimps were as large as its reputation and fresh judging by the texture, but sadly they were lacking in flavor. The onion rings were also strangely bland too. I thought it was disappointing that the cole slaw was the only thing that tastes like something.The bottom line is that Christie's, especially its fried shrimps, is an experience that should be had at least once if you are into the Houston dining scene because of its history, but do not expect anything surprising from the food here.*Go during weekday lunch or happy hour for cheaper pricings. You can secure an entree of six signature fried shrimps, which includes cole slaw and fries (Substitute it for onion rings if you like) for $13.95.---tl;dr version:1) Nice decor that tricks you into thinking you are close at Bay2) Southern hospitality = Pleasant dining experience3) Bland and disappointing seafood","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,christies-seafood-and-steaks-houston,christies-seafood-and-steahttps://www.yelp.com/biz/christies-seafood-and-steaks-houston?start=0,christies-seafood-and-steaks-houston,Gracie E.,"Houston, TX",0,14,,,8/14/17,"My Fried Shrimp was really good, gave my lots of sauces.

Not a total loss seeing as how adding table salt and pepper easily fixed it, but I do like the seasoning charred into the meat. I don't normally order baked potatoes as sides as it tends to be a bit much, but the size of it was perfect especially considering the gumbo. Again, that too was a bit bland even with the sour cream, butter, cheese and chives. I'm a bacon bits fan so that may have been the letdown for me.The gumbo had the most flavor but it was something different about it. I kind of smelled and tasted like they put curry in it.

Onion rings 4 - not the style I like (I prefer tempura style to the flat coating), but good for what they were. Baked potato 5 - fluffy with a tender skin (I like to eat the skin) and super-loaded as I had requested. Hubby said the burger was good. It was also more than he could eat.

I had ordered it stirred (mentioning as an aside that that meant I did not want it watered down, even elaborating that the time in contact with the ice should be limited.)

Normally it's a layover on flights but this time I was actually sent here for company business. After a long day of work and heading to the hotel to change, I found myself down at the Medical Center area and was ready for dinner. My thought was to head to the Galleria area to find a place to eat, so I headed that way.After driving down Westheimer Road and seeing all the chains and regular resturants I decided to pull over and use my Yelp application on my HTC EVO. So I started my search and was in the mood for some seafood since I'm close enough to the ocean. I found Christie's.After reading some reviews I was hoping that they were right. I went in and immediately got greeted by multiple employees. As I looked around it looked like an older establishment, which I don't mind, especially if the food was good. While being seated by the hostess I was asked if I would like a drink while I waited for my waiter, which I appreciated. While I mulled over the choices I was taken back by the amount of good choices. Nothing fancy here as far as fowl or seafood from some tiny island in the Pacific. Just plain menu items that feature keywords like ""Gulf Shrimp"", ""Canadian Sea Scallops"" and the like. I can appreciate knowing where the seafood is from but they need not try to impress me with unknown locations for descriptions, I'll let the food do the talking.After a brief time, my waiter came to greet me and brought me a drink and asked if I was ready to order. I asked about the market price for the oysters and asked about a couple items on the menu. I told him to give me 5 minutes and he did. When he came back, I ordered the Crawfish Bisque and the Fried Shrimp and Oyster plate with baked potato. Sounded good to me. Off the waiter when to put in my order and then brought me bread and butter. Okay the bread was fresh crusty and good. The butter was plain jane, nothing special, not like it was whipped or honey butter. However the bread was pretty good and hot! When my dinner came the potato looked like a good size. A good amount of Shrimp and nice plump oysters. The breading wasn't too thick and it was just enough and light. Now the shrimp was incredibly good. Not overcooked, large, fresh and was downright tasty. I could eat a bunch of these puppies. Now the oysters were very good too. Not under or overcooked, nice light breading and was absolutely delicious! During the entire meal, my waiter was attentive and refilled my Diet Coke whenever it got low. Other wait staff would walk by and check on me too. Maybe it was because I am incredibly good looking but probably because they provide great service.I like this resturant, I'm glad I skipped the chains and tried something new. I would come back to this resturant any time. Enjoy!","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,christies-seafood-and-steaks-houston,christies-seafood-and-steahttps://www.yelp.com/biz/christies-seafood-and-steaks-houston?start=60,christies-seafood-and-steaks-houston,Chris L.,"Houston, TX",31,14,7,,9/6/14,"My girlfriend and I went for a nice dinner here and were disappointed.

The place was literally empty and it felt a little creepy like ""The Shining"" creepy. Then we sat down and looked at the menu, the prices seem steep but don't let that fool you! We ordered the Calamari Appetizer, Shrimp and Catfish Plate, and the Shrimp Alfredo. To be honest, the Calamari itself was so so, but the tomato sauce seemed fresh and there was a LOT of calamari. I nearly got full off the appetizer alone.Next, my boyfriend's salad and my crawfish bisque came. These came with our entrees. The crawfish bisque was d.e.licious and hit the spot. It was hot, creamy, rich, and the crawfish in it were great. And both were in generation portions.NOW... the kicker... my boyfriend's Shrimp and Catfish Plate come out. Huge shrimp and a generous portion of catfish. My Shrimp Alfredo comes out with huge shrimp but not the ""Red Lobster"" portion I was expecting. The surprise is that the fried shrimp is perfectly crispy and delicious on the outside without being greasy AT ALL. There's no weird oily residue! This is accredited to some kind of special oil that they use. If I recall correctly there is a whole story on the fried shrimp and oil on their menu. The shrimp was nice and firm like a lobster tail, and the catfish was buttery and flaky. HANDS DOWN BEST SHRIMP ALFREDO I'VE HAD YET. I know how to make alfredo dang it, but this one.... whew. The parmesan they use must be aged because you can really taste the nuttiness in the sauce. It tasted SO home-made. It was rich but not too thick. The portion doesn't look big but, I kid you not, I made the food last for 4 days just so I could taste it again and again. Maybe half because I was poor as well (ha ha).Surely you've passed Christie's up time and time again and never thought of going in.

But since gas is kinda spendy right now and our place to beat is in Galveston, saving time and money to find a good enough place here seems to be a worthy investment. I decided to go with a living legend who had their origins in ... Guess where? Galveston! This spot is kinda deceiving from the outside with the lighthouse and white washed walls, inside it is all tablecloths and silverware. There is a bar that has happy hour specials too for the lush in you. On to the food. I had the catfish platter. It was a nicely sized portion, fried perfectly golden brown with fried and some pretty decent cole slaw. What irked me was the warm tartar sauce (maybe the heating lamp too high?) and the bland catfish. It was just okay and lacked any kind of oomph on the seasoning end. Ith fish sandwich was slightly better but still was lacking in the flavor department. So trial #1 ends in failure.

The seafood fondue was pretty good...the oysters weren't the best though, but it's the start of the season and they didn't have any fresh ones so that probably explains it. The buttery dunking bread it was served with was not in hefty supply and they charge for extra so we subbed free hot fresh rolls after we ran out to dunk in the fondue. Both were fairly tasty, mostly because of the freshness factor. The crab balls were good...just like a balled up crab cake. Interesting remoulade too...good but appeared to have a lot of mayo. The shrimp were the star of the show though. Light and crunchy breading, almost like panko bread crumbs. These were no heavy thickly battered shrimp, but they were perfect in every way.

You don't stay in business for as long as Christie's has without keeping your quality high. Christie's establishment has been on Westheimer for many years, which means that the building is a little old and the parking lot is in serious need of resurfacing and painting, but that doesn't take away from the high quality of service and food found inside.The restaurant features an oyster bar to your right as you walk in, and a water fountain and hostess stand to your left. There is nothing outstanding about the decor in this restaurant, in fact, it made me feel transported back to the 70's when this restaurant was probably last updated with new furniture and decor. It is all very clean, it just looks like they haven't changed much from the time I was born.Arrive early to sit in this cheesy lounge that will make you feel as though you have returned to a decade of polyester shirts, disco music, and the thick mustache worn by so many men. Don't mistaken the way the bar looks for the service you will get. The bartenders are incredibly knowledgeable and full of ability to make you whatever you would like. All of the staff from hostesses, bartenders, waiters, and busers are incredibly professional, friendly, and courteous.This is a classy restaurant that still has waiters in waist aprons, white table cloths, and cloth napkins. I've sat in a booth both times, and from the looks of the chairs, the booth is always a good idea. It hasn't been crowded on either of my visits, so a reservation may not be needed unless you have a larger party.I had the same waitress and same table on both occasions...very deja vu. However, the food choices were entirely different on both occasions. I sat down with the intention of being here for the long haul of a full 5 course meal.First course was the shrimp chowder. Typically when I think of chowder, I picture in my mind little bits of shrimp with too much corn. Not this chowder. It had large chunks of cut up shrimp, and hardly a piece of corn in sight. The chowder was very smooth, creamy, with just the right amount of seasoning, and served up steaming hot.Second course was their 6 boiled shrimp and 6 oysters on the half shell. The shrimp were not over boiled and had a hint of seafood seasoning and the oysters were plump and meaty. The cocktail sauce was probably four times the amount of cocktail sauce than I actually needed, but better too much than not enough. The only complaint I have about this course was that the price was listed as MKT (market) on the menu. Unless you ask, you don't know what you are spending on this otherwise inexpensive appetizer for the Houston area.Third course was the house salad. Nothing special to talk about. hard croutons, red onion slices, and green leaf lettuce with two wedge slices of tomato. I would have skipped the salad and opted for more veggies because it was very unimaginative and plain.Fourth course was dinner. I decided to indulge my need for fried food and ordered their famous fried shrimp of 4 fried shrimp and two stuffed shrimp. The shrimp was fresh and was just lightly breaded and fried just right. You would think it was easy to find good fried shrimp in Houston, but it's hard because so many restaurants aren't careful about the temperature when frying seafood. The shrimp were light and crispy on the outside while the shrimp were tender and flavorful. Absolutely an enjoyable and worthy way to send my calorie and fat intake over the edge.After four courses, I decided to go ahead and skip the fifth course of dessert. Nothing on the dessert menu looked appetizing as I had already stuffed myself. On my previous visit, I had tried the desserts. They are good, but nothing special to return here for.

We were not disappointed by the oldest restaurant in Houston (Since 1917). We started with calamari and fried zucchini. The marinara sauce for the calamari is a creation of Mr Christie and added a great flavor. The zucchini and accompanying sauce became a source of conflict as my family fought over the remaining slices. I had the fish sandwich which has been a staple of the menu since the beginning. The fish itself was light and flaky and the breaking was fantastic. I devoured the fish filet without even touching the toasted bun. We threw in an order of stuffed shrimp. While the taste of the shrimp was enough to make you want to steal a piece from your child's plate, the remoulade sauce stole the show.

The Rib Eye was donned with mushroom and the brown marinades and it was grilled to perfection...the steak was so tender I can just rip it apart with my fork only. It was juicy and full of flavor throughout the meat. I had come purposely for the seafood, but turned out I was more impressed with the Steak :)Tonight was our first time dining at Christie's and we liked it.Definitely the best steak I have had so far...and we tried many steak houses before including Pappas Seafood. This can't be beat.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,christies-seafood-and-steaks-houston,christies-seafood-and-steahttps://www.yelp.com/biz/christies-seafood-and-steaks-houston?start=120,christies-seafood-and-steaks-houston,Cheryn P.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,,8/30/13,"I've had a lot of successes with HRW this year so, when a work friend was in from out of town I thought I would find something that is uniquely Houston, hence Christie's. The service was excellent. That is the only good thing I can say. The cars outside fooled me into thinking the restaurant was busy. They must have been staff cars as the staff to guest ratio was 1:1. I cannot stop apologizing to my friend that her first time tasting Gumbo it was this bland bowl of brown gravy. For main courses we had the steak option and the shrimp/crab cake option. Again, no flavor. I have tried a few steaks this round of HRW, and every one I had previously was good. This tasted like it came from that old restaurant (I don't think it's still around) Ponderosa. For dessert we had the chocolate mousse cake and bananas foster cake. Each had a strange taste and the strawberry garnish was mushy. If anything we ate was fresh, the chef managed to make it taste like it came directly from the freezer. Food-wise this was my worst dining experience in Houston.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,christies-seafood-and-steaks-houston,christies-seafood-and-stea
