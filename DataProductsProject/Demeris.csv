That was a while ago, so I've been a fan for a long time. I've eaten at a few BBQ places in Houston (not a huge BBQ eater), so my review is not based on a good representation of options. Despite this, Demeris is my only favorite (aside from Dreamland BBQ in Tuscaloosa, AL). I love the full rack of ribs!! So yummy!! The meat was falling off the bone and the sauce was just right. I also recommend the loaded baked potato. The Greek fries are food, but they can be very salty with the feta cheese and spices.The last time I went I wanted the Turtle Cheesecake, but they said they no longer sold it. Bummer!","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,demeris-bar-b-q-houston-3,demeris-bar-b-q-houston-3https://www.yelp.com/biz/demeris-bar-b-q-houston-3?start=0,Ken M.,"Houston, TX",0,238,,,11/4/17,"Placed an order to go online. I arrived and was confused. They moved the pickup area from its usual spot and I didn't see where to pickup to go orders. So I stood in line for 10 mins where people were placing orders. When I finally got to the front of the line, the cashier told me I needed to go to the bar area to get the order. I asked her where the sign was to indicate that and a large lady behind her begin laughing at me and said ""it's behind you. are you Blind?"" I was shocked at her comment and asked where. She pointed behind me and just kept laughing, I asked her name. She laughed and walked into the back room at the urging of the cashier. Never have I had such terrible service from this place.To make matters worse, while my pulled pork potatoe was good, the brisket potatoe was so fatty my partner could not eat it.Will not come back to this place.

Shepherd and remember being unimpressed and not returning. It wasn't a bad experience just not memorable either. Last night I visited this newer location that is conveniently located on the 610 Loop where it intersects with Hwy 290 which makes it barely inside the Loop.This restaurant has good parking available. Walking in I immediately decided that I liked the interior. There is a nice covered outdoor seating area with a fireplace and TV. Indoors they have a main dining room, a smaller separated dining room that can be used for special events and then a small bar. Being new everything is nice inside. Walking to the counter to order I noticed that the Wednesday special was 2 meats and two sides for $12.25. Other nights have other specials. I ordered the special and asked for sliced brisket and chicken breast for the meats and the beans and potato salad for the sides. I paid and the food was immediately ready for me to take to my table. They also gave me two slices of bread (see pic).The beans were good and were like regular pork and beans. I could tell a slight flavor of seasoning in them and graded them a 3. The potato salad was mayo based and nice and cool with good flavor (3.5). The brisket with sauce slathered over it was ok but just a 3. The boneless chicken breast was already sliced for me. The meat was moist and I could detect a slight smoke flavor (3.5). Their BBQ sauce is rather mild for my tastes and is at best a 3. As you can see from my review a lot of 3's here. Nothing that I ate was bad but in a town with such good BBQ I have no reason to return. There are some non BBQ items on the menu. This is typical chain style BBQ. It is a nice place to eat however their BBQ quality just doesn't make me want to return just like my visit to the original location years ago.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,demeris-bar-b-q-houston-3,demeris-bar-b-q-houston-3https://www.yelp.com/biz/demeris-bar-b-q-houston-3?start=0,Nikia H.,"Houston, TX",294,69,305,Elite ’17,10/31/16,"Their ranch is amazing!

In the middle of my workday I was trying to find somewhere to eat on my way to my next destination, and just happen to be driving right by them, and recognized the name on their sign but never really knew where they were. The parking lot was packed, which is always a good sign. I parked in the back and made my way in, and immediately was a little concerned because inside there was quite a long line waiting to order, and this was again my lunch break from work. Suddenly, a very energetic and friendly lady appeared and offered the gentleman in front of me to come to the bar where he could get seated and served much more quickly. She then asked me if I would like to come as well, so of course I took her up on that as did two people that were in front of the gentleman she first approached. She took us to the bar area where there were several seats available and we were immediately seated. She then asked all of us for our drink orders got them right away, and then also took our food orders. All of our food literally came out in less than five minutes from when we ordered it! I am almost positive that had I been stuck in that front line, I wouldn't even have ordered by the time I received my food at the bar. I had my yelp app pulled up and was checking in when a guy from the kitchen brought my food over... I could've sworn I saw him give her a slight nod, (and perhaps this influenced the service) but nevertheless, Regina was amazing! She was super energetic and engaging with people at the bar and really seem to be having fun and enjoying her job. She even joked that she should go pull more people over.

Some was put on our sandwiches but really they should have included a lot on the side because the brisket tasted like boiled meat. No flavor at all. I've bought frozen brisket at HEB that had more flavor than this stuff did.

It's always the leaner cut which in no way tastes as good as the top meat. I've complained to Yonny Demeris a couple of times and he had always responded but the last time this occurred, I sent a note and a picture to him and he totally ignored me. I couldn't believe it.Anyway, the primary meat slicer / sandwich preparer pays absolutely no attention when asked to prepare one from the loose cut meat and I've noticed him for years always acting as if he must use every piece of the brisket and push it to customers. I hate this type of overbearing personality in an individual and have just given up on being abused in this manner.Finally, on several occassions I've had hairs in the potato salad and it's infuriating when this happens.

I have lived in this fair city for 20 plus years and over that time I have had a few plates of Demeris barbecue either at their Shepard location or catered events. I proclaim it classic Houston BBQ because I have eaten this same bland plate of roasted meats covered in sauce all over Houston for the last 20 years. Demeris is one of the big names in Houston BBQ. They have been around since 1964 so they are part of the blame for 4 lost Houston decades of serving this sauce covered roast beef. This is a new location but actually a relocation from a strip center that was torn down for the Hwy 290 expansion.I scored Demeris a 70 out of 100. This is classic Houston Bum Steer BBQ.Smoke: Hickory. At this location the smoker is walled off like Fort Knox. There is a smoke stack (been fooled before) but not a stack of wood in sight. The smoker is not visible from the cafeteria line. I know that JR Manufacturing lists Demeris as a client. Wood or Gasser? Who knows. I trust JR so I'll go with wood fired which makes this plate of BBQ even more sad.Brisket: Fair. 1/8 in smoke ring beneath a paper thin bark (gasser?). Mild faint smoke. Tested tough of tender. No detectable rub flavor. Its a slice of roast beef. Use the sauce.Ribs: Fair. Get the toothpicks. This spare rib was chewy tough. Lots a tearing and dirty bone. Mild faint smoke. No detectable rub left. Use the sauce.Sausage: Fair. A course ground beef link with herb seasoning. It was like combining Central Texas, East Texas and Czech. It did not work. It was very dry. No after taste. Little smoke. Use the sauce.Sauce: Good. A thick tomato base mild sweet sauce. It was buttery. It was served warm and developed a skin like queso cheese. Nice. Everything thing here needs sauce so just have them drown the plate.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,demeris-bar-b-q-houston-3,demeris-bar-b-q-houston-3https://www.yelp.com/biz/demeris-bar-b-q-houston-3?start=20,Ben B.,"Houston, TX",4,72,34,,4/22/15,"I've been eating here for years, mainly when it was on the opposite side of the loop, closer to Northwest Mall.

Well-trimmed and a nice taste overall and texture.Chicken--a tad dry, but that actually works with the smoky flavor of the meat. A real favorite for me personally.Ribs--another very good item, very meaty and moist. Another favorite.The sauce is a touch watery, but still within my acceptable limits. Sides are very good with the Mac and cheese the best of the lot in my opinion. I'd probably give this overall 3 stars, but the 4th star is for Miss Regina who is the Queen of this restaurant: friendly, smiling and she will take of you with your order--so BE NICE TO HER, because she deserves back the happiness she gives her customers.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,demeris-bar-b-q-houston-3,demeris-bar-b-q-houston-3https://www.yelp.com/biz/demeris-bar-b-q-houston-3?start=20,Larry S.,"Houston, TX",0,11,,,12/16/16,went to a party they had catered the food had to be the worst I have ever had. the sauce was so bad . the link was like maybe a blue ribbon link. give this place a wide berth. the brisket was fresh out of the boiling pot.,"alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,demeris-bar-b-q-houston-3,demeris-bar-b-q-houston-3https://www.yelp.com/biz/demeris-bar-b-q-houston-3?start=20,Rey B.,"Houston, TX",1,6,4,,4/30/16,"Not the best Bbq in town, the Customer service is great I must say.

The ribs are good but a bit dry. The sausage is better than average for most BBQ places. My favorite and standby is the brisket. Moderate smoke, good flavor, nice texture.

However, I recently had a meeting at the new location on the Loop, and was so impressed I went back this weekend to pick up food for my family.With a 3 year old and a 3 month old, we try to avoid restaurants simply because we feel bad about the inevitable destruction that ensues with two little kids. Plus, it is really weird to eat at 5:30. Only people with toddlers or those receivng Social Security eat dinner before 6:30 on most days.The decor is great. Lots of flatscreen TVs. Good clean bathrooms. A small but nice bar, and a nice patio area with more flatscreens. Would probably be good to catch all or part of a game here.The BBQ at Demeris is above average to great, depending on what you get. The brisket I had this last time was lean, very smoky, and full of good flavor. We also had BBQ chicken, which retained juice and had good flavor as well.My take out order was done in about 7 minutes. They also have a drive through, but I wanted to wait inside to watch NFL on TV.Some of the sides, like the green beans, were just ok, but others (like the cole slaw and jalapeno corn) were excellent and full of flavor.This is a good place to take a family, and I'll probably drag my clan in there in the next few weekends.

A few weeks ago, we decided to make a stop at this location for some barbecue. We liked the larger, newer venue. That is all we liked about it. It just went horribly wrong after we walked in the door. My husband was very specific in his food order. The person taking the order repeated it correctly to the personnel preparing the food, but his order come out completely wrong. The man taking the order watched those guys preparing the food, and he never corrected them. The order was simple. The two mean dinner with brisket, cut from the loose side, dry, with a serving of sauce on the side and ribs. What he got was brisket from the lean side. Both the ribs and the brisket were smothered in sauce. My husband was not happy, but decided to try it anyway, thinking it would taste good. Boy, was he wrong. The meat was dry and flavorless, even with the overload of sauce, which was vinegary and runny. The ribs were fatty and tough. I won't even discuss the potato salad and cole slaw. We were shocked. The only conclusion we could draw was that Demeris Barbecue (at least this location) was no longer owned by the Demeris family, thereby explaining the nosedive in quality. And, to top it all off, their prices were way too steep, especially considering the inferior quality. We will never, ever visit this restaurant. I doubt they even care, but if the Demeris family does still own all of its locations, they need to revamp and recharge.

This location was incredibly clean, but had kind of a chain restaurant feel to it. The food was up quick. The sides were all very good and well-seasoned (mac and cheese, beans, Mexican rice, fries). The meat, the cornerstone of any BBQ meal, was OK. The brisket was tender and the highlight. The ribs were good - but the jalapeno sausage didn't have much fire, and was nothing special. The biggest detractor was the smothering of it all in a very tangy sauce. The portions are decent, the fixins were good, and overall not a bad experience.

Dried out turkey in watery 'gravy', soupy flavorless mashed potatoes and green beans boiled into near mush. The stuffing was tasty and nicely spiced. Dinner rolls that could be used to repair a stone wall. Soupy apple pie, pumpkin pie that's more pudding, and an Ok overly sweet pecan pie. Good iced tea, though. This was reminiscent of the horrifying American meal plan at college that students rioted over mid-year, and caused the food vendor to get fired. There are a number of restaurants who represented their cuisine in catering off-site better than Demeris did here.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,demeris-bar-b-q-houston-3,demeris-bar-b-q-houston-3https://www.yelp.com/biz/demeris-bar-b-q-houston-3?start=80,Stephen D.,"Tomball, TX",0,2,2,,7/1/09,Excellent excellent excellent BBQ.

They are huge, like the size of your face, and while I think they are steamed rather than truly baked, they are still good and relatively inexpensive. I like the fully loaded baked potato which comes with the usual fixin's like cheese, sour cream, and green onion, but also comes topped with meat (beef or turkey) and a side of BBQ sauce. I usually only half the potato and save the rest for leftovers. I haven't tried their BBQ, but I would only go here for the potato. The guys that make your food are freaking fast--you'll have your food ready by the time you pay and walk to the end of the counter. The sweet tea is also very delicious; it tastes like they use real sugar. We dined in this past week for the first time. You get your own drinks and silverware, but they'll bus your table for you.
