I have been here many times and I am never disappointed. I usually come during lunch and order the chicken fried steak, with Mac n cheese, & corn. Everything is amazing. The Buttery, fried goodness and the portions are enormous. During lunch it's $10.99 so you get a good deal! I also come during the weekends at 2 or 3 AM and everything taste great.I've ordered a grilled chicken Cesar salad before and it is more than enough.

I'm a native Houstonian and grew up in the Gulfgate area. I remember coming to Dot's in the 1970's and 80's. Today, I took the opportunity to take my mom to lunch. She still lives in the house I grew up in so Dot's was close. I realized when I walked in that it had been 30+ years since I had been here. The old saying is true: The more things change, the more things stay the same.First of all, don't be fooled by the name. Dot's Coffee Shop is much more than a coffee shop. It is a full blown restaurant with a pretty good variety on the menu. They do have a multitude of daily specials every day of the week that comes with a large portion of the special and three sides. My mom and I both ordered one of the Monday specials. She ordered the fried catfish with coleslaw, mashed potatoes and mac & cheese. She gave the mac & cheese to my college aged daughter. I ordered the Pot Roast with green beans, pinto beans, and rice/gravy. Everything on my plate was very good. I normally don't add salt to anything but I did add a little to this meal to make the flavors really pop. I was really surprised how much food came on this daily special. I was STUFFED when I left. My mom took 1/2 of her meal home to eat for dinner. I would have been shocked if my 92 year old mom could have eaten all of the food. It was a TON. Honestly, there was enough food on one meal that we could have split something. In the future, I will. I just didn't realize how much came on one order. My son ordered the 3-pancake breakfast and was also stuffed. Keep in mind he is 18 and has the metabolism of a Kentucky Derby racehorse. My 21 year old daughter ordered the Philly Cheesesteak with again, was massive. She only are 1/2 and ate the other 1/2 for dinner tonight. For all four of us with one drink (three had water) and tip, I spent $55.00. I did not think that was bad at all for everything we got. Besides, I got to spend another afternoon with my mom which at her age, I need to take advantage of those moments. Make sure you look at my pics to see pictures of our four meals. I even through in a bonus photo of mom and me.

I figured a salad wouldn't take too long to prepare, so I called in the order when I left my office at 11. When I arrived, the restaurant itself wasn't that busy, but there were 3 customers waiting for to go orders (one of which was a police officer) and they did not look happy. So when I told the hostess I had an order for pickup, she asked me to take a seat, that there were people in front of me. I thought that was strange, usually take out orders come out as they are ready. I sat down and waited for 45 minutes for my salad, while my waiting comrades and I got more and more frustrated, the officer most of all. A hostess finally came and asked if I'd like a drink while I waited. I told her I'd rather have an estimate of when my food would be ready. She went and checked and came back and told me it's actually been ready... I asked if I could have it then? She said well you have to pay first (I am internally steaming at this point since nobody came to tell me my order was ready). So I stand at the counter for another 10 minutes because they were insistent on having take out customers pay in the order that they arrived.

Great pie!Dot is the original Pappas restaurant of the Pappas restaurant chains, including Pappadeaux and Pappasitos. I believe Dot was built in the 60s and is located near Gulfgate mall on the I45 service road. The restaurant is a diner and I can imagine it looks just like it did back in the 60s. Everything is clean, and nothing looks old or worn.I met a friend there on a Friday afternoon and we had some pie. Dot has a good selection of shakes and pies. There are also daily meal specials listed on the menu.The apple pie looked good, so I ordered a slice a la mode. The pie was fresh and delicious. The apples were still slightly crisp and the scoop of ice cream tasted like Blue Bell. Awesome.I was carb-loading for the MS-150, so I also enjoyed a delicious roll with butter. The roll was huge, about the size of two rolls put together, and was light and fluffy. I could eat these rolls all day.Dot is a coffee house, so I ordered a cup of coffee to go.

Over several visits I haven't found a bad dish in the traditional diner staples. Open 24 hours, Dot is quite popular. Peak times you will likely have to wait to enjoy.We usually visit heading out of Galveston towards home. That usually puts our visits between breakfast and lunch. One visit the wife and I ordered a biscuit ahead of our breakfast plates to share; possibly to soak of some of the libations consumed on the island. Think baseball sized paired with gravy or preserves. I ended up not finishing my steak and egg number taking half a ribeye back to Austin.Another visit I decided to go the lunch route and indulged in the fried mushrooms with delicious ranch (sorry Joe C.) as a starter. A generous portion of golden brown goodness as only a diner can deliver. I also decided to revisit one of my old friends from years past; damn good club sandwich with my choice of corn bread dressing. Service has always been attentive and pleasant despite the constant turning of the tables. The pie case that greets you upon entry is amazing. I've been so full on both visits I haven't had any room to try the many creations.

The slices are HUGE, and I was the only person to finish mine (plus some of everyone else's). They were all terrific, but the coconut cream was exceptional. The crust on the key lime was perfect. The strawberries were the size of my fist, and the glaze gave me everything I needed and more. The Oreo pie was very sweet, but you can't spell dessert without...nevermind. Our server asked us if we wanted some complimentary dinner rolls. Duh? Don't forget the butter. The rolls are so bomb and I always take some to go. Their lunch platter is $9.95 for an entrée and three sides. Dinner only costs a few bucks more. I've had the smothered pork chops, chicken fried steak, and chicken fried chicken. I don't usually like gravy, but what they serve here is liquid crack. I could drink this gravy. As for sides, I recommend the cornbread dressing, mac 'n cheese, and steamed cabbage. My effort to be a little healthier was squandered because the cabbage came with bacon.

I actually stopped by Dot Coffee Shop twice during my recent Houston trip, once just to get some dessert to go, and the other for a late night bite.My dessert trip consisted of a banana cream pie to go, which was a huge portion. The pie didn't like the rather aggressive drive back to my hotel as it kind of toppled onto itself, but nonetheless it was a very goof banana cream pie. The custard was very light, but my only gripe was that the cream to custard ratio was a bit off; a little too much cream to custard.My second visit to Dot was for a larger late night meal. Portions are humongous and my group of friends from NY/NJ were certainly not used to the Texas sized portions!I tried the chicken fried steak which was tasty, but the proportion of breading to steak was disproportionate. The breading concealed a pretty small and thin steak. The steak was pretty good though.I also ordered the oatmeal bowl with fruit that was served with raisins, brown sugar, milk, and butter. Excellent oatmeal and the addition of butter (while a bit odd) added some nice richness to the oatmeal.A huge shout out for the complimentary dinner rolls (as many other yelp reviews have mentioned) that are fabulous!

Like most well known and loved breakfast, we were met with a long line that moved surprisingly fast. No worries though. The smells swirling around this coffee shop just made me hungrier. When seated, we both ordered hot coffee and were brought out water by default. I ordered one of the lunchtime specials- chicken fried chicken with Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and turnips and greens. The greens were a consolation to myself for the carbo-loaded order, but that's neither here nor there anymore. Besides, the huge basket of complimentary bread (yeast rolls and corn bread with butter) made my veggie efforts seem futile. Our food was delivered an appropriately short time after ordering which was shocking because of the business. The mashed potatoes and white white were wonderfully seasoned. Seriously. I'm so used to bland white gravy on chicken fried whatever that this was a surprise. The actual chicken was huge and tender.

When I entered the restaurant the staff was seated at the tables and standing at the wait stations talking amongst themselves, which is fine. However when you are a customer and waiting around for service this type of mentality can be detrimental to business. I waited about five minutes before I started glaring at what looked like a manager. Eventually she yelled out to someone and a young women named Diana attended to me.She took my order promptly and delivered superb coffee and cream. (I enjoy how they leave the dispenser for seconds or thirds!) I made my order and my food was delivered quickly. The place was starting to redeem itself, when my order arrived and I was pleasantly greeted with a MOUNTAIN of an omelet. The servings are no joke... it was simply monstrous. Which I desire from small diners like these. Then a man with a small suitcase sat down two tables away. Some of the other staff greeted him and it seemed like he was a regular. He started chatting up a middle aged female server and then he placed his bag on the table. I was attempting to make a dent in my massive meal when I noticed the employee spraying what looked like perfume on herself. This is odd I thought... but then another female employee and a male employee approached the man at the table and also started conversing. At this point the scene had become clear. This guy was trying to sell goods to the restaurant staff. Odd place to pitch a product I thought, but I continued eating my plate. The smell of perfume started to fill the space as one employee after another began to spray different scents onto themselves laughing about it and carrying on as if this was common place. The place was starting to get busy and at least 12 tables had patrons and yet 4 of the staff at this point were haggling and spraying different scents onto themselves...Overall the food was a bit greasy but it came fast and was filled with what you might expect from a breakfast joint. Diana was attentive, friendly and the coffee was spot on. The diner was clean and bright and it looked the part. It would of impressed me if it wasn't for the street salesman and otherwise lack of professionalism from the staff. The management apparently turns a blind eye because this practice seemed normal. If this stuff goes without consequence I can't imagine what might go on in the kitchenNo seconds for me please.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,dot-coffee-shop-houston,dot-coffee-shop-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/dot-coffee-shop-houston?start=160,Taylor D.,"MacGregor, Houston, TX",207,12,148,,3/10/15,"I feel like this place is overrated...

Our wait was supposed to be 5-10 minutes, but ended up 20. We were seated and quickly noticed the silverware was caked with food. The waitress took the fork away to exchange it and that's when we saw it. There on the napkin in all its glory was the most disgusting..booger! That alone made me want to head for the door! Omg it was so nasty. We told the waitress and she took the whole napkin, silverware and all. Didn't say a word about it, not an I'm sorry about that or anything. our waitress was not very personable/friendly either. Did not greet us when we sat, the first words out of her mouth were ""do you know what you want to eat?""....about half way through our meal I noticed the table next to us, with the same waitress, asking for the manager. I could not hear much but what I did hear, they were having the same issues with the waitress. My boyfriend decided our meal was over when a nat actually landed in his ketchup and hash-browns.

Our mothers and our grand-mothers filled our tables and our bellies with it. My 91 yr. old mother-in-law loves the Dot; it's the same food she grew up eating on a farm in Tennessee and my own Texan mother fried everything but our water. My daddy made a helluva cream gravy. The dishes at Dot taste like home cooking, not restaurant supply.Where do I start? The turkey and cornbread dressing tastes like the best you've had at Thanksgiving. Our chicken-fried chicken and pork chops were cooked to perfection- the cream gravy was smooth, thick and perfectly seasoned! The mashed potatoes never taste watery and are so flavorful. It's such a simple dish, but so hard to get right. I always get the huge carrot coins with butter, always sweet, never bitter, and my hubby and MIL swoon over the flat Italian green beans cooked with bacon. An unexpected standout is the coleslaw - all four of us ordered it this time after we swept through Mom's order on our last visit . A dish that so often is a bland mushy mayo mess is elevated here by something special - perhaps horseradish or Creole mustard. It's almost gingery. Try it! Beware the fragrant basket of hot, huge yeasty rolls and corn muffins that they bring to the table before your dinner - unbelievably good and impossible to resist. The portions are huge. Neither my hubby nor I are dainty eaters, but we always have plenty of food to take home for another meal, along with a slice of pie, of course! The service has always been impeccable and down-home friendly.

Dot's Coffee is one of the go to spots near UH. It is especially busy after UH events and later into the evenings on the weekends. The wait can run over 45 minutes.

What keeps people from going hungry are the huge bread rolls they slap down in front of you. If you are not careful you may be full before you get your meal off those things. The bread, butter and honey will nail that one in you. Things that taste pretty good there: Most breakfast items, Pork Chops, Country Fried Steak.

Even so, I've never had any of the servers be anything but polite, if not a little rushed. Tip 'em like you would anyone else, it's only proper.Get the chicken fried chicken or pot roast if its the right day for them, the mashed potatoes and gravy (if you like white gravy...it's killer), and the vegetable sides are always great.

Dot Coffee Shop is in the area I grew up in. Have not been there in many, many years. But due to YELP, I was reminded of it and made arrangements to eat there.It was a flash from the past for me so that was neat. Actually everything about it was pretty neat. All the service staff was excellent. The food was thumbs up for diner food. The ambience was pure old time diner. And I really considered buying a homemade pie to go, but I was not headed home so did not.The only thing I was sort of disappointed in was that I found out it was not just a mom and pop owned place, which is something I assumed all of my life. But I guess from 1967 when it opened, it was and still is ""family"" owned. The PAPPAS Bros. I think this was their first restaurant. But I guess that explains the excellent wait staff since they go through very determined training.Omlettes are outstanding. I am getting that next time for breakfast. I had the pancakes that were fluffy and beautiful, but they had some sort of orange zest in it which I do not care for. Endless coffee was delicious. I also want to go back for lunch and try just about anything they offer. Burger for instance.Oh, and did I mention clean? This place was spic and span from the floors to the tables to the restrooms.

And yes, food wise there is always better than a diner. But remember, it's a diner. In that regard, this place delivers. Not sure if it's a five star food spot, however it is top notch in what it is: a kitschy 24/7 diner where one can drink a seemingly endless stream of coffee. For that reason, it gets a high rating in my book. It serves a good french toast plate and the dinner and pie looks promising from my first visit. I plan to return to this place some day to see what other fare it offers.I don't believe it's House-of-Pies good for dessert quality, however I could be wrong from the looks of their dessert case. Quantity-wise, there weren't near as many pies to choose from as House of Pies, Houston's other leading supplier of diner kitsch. Both places transport you back to an era that only seems to exist somewhere between the 1970s and the last trailer park you passed on the highway. The service is good as well, with staff powering through and working on holidays and as a plus: There are no jerky YOU MUST PAY OUR WAIT STAFF signs and obscure soup-nazi-esqe rules about seating and such (I'm looking at you House of Pies).

It consistently took a long time for our food to come out, so I learned quickly that this is not the place to stop by for a bite before class. The chicken fried steak here is not the best that I have ever had; I remember it being really tough and dry. The only breakfast item I liked on the menu was their french toast from their Paris Grand Prix, but even then, it never made me WANT food at Dot; it was just the safe thing to order when I came with friends.All in all, it is a good place to go if you are student at UH - the prices are decent, there is unlimited coffee, and it is not Taco Bell or Chick Fil A.

He raved about the food, and after one visit, I can see why. He mostly goes for dinner, but it was convenient for me to go for brunch. It was also convenient for half of Houston to go at the same time. After 20 minutes, we were seated. Not too bad. Once we were seated, we sat. And sat. And... you get the idea. Finally, a waitress approached. Woohoo! We'd at least get some coffee now. What we actually got was, ""Bear with me, Hon, we're swamped."" Way to state the obvious, Miss. A little while later (in geological terms) she returned and actually took our coffee order. Even came back with coffee, including a carafe, pretty quickly. Note to Dot: If you're going to provide a smallish carafe of coffee to a table of three, it is wise to see if they need a refill occasionally. Food orders were taken at this point and the waiting game continued. We were entertained by an amazing volume of crowd noise and ESPN coverage of the Chinese Little League team scoring 16 unanswered runs on Aruba. Poor little Arubans. At long last, we were treated to another visit by our waitress, who asked if we would like a complimentary bread basket like all the other tables seem to have gotten when they sat down. Why, yes. I think we would like that since my blood glucose level is dropping faster than the Dow. Turns out it was just a tease. No such basket ever materialized. Note to Dot: If you're going to offer free biscuits, rolls and muffins, please deliver free biscuits, rolls and muffins.Despite the lack of bread, we were all still conscious when the meals did, in fact, arrive. The dishes were unceremoniously deposited in close proximity to the people who ordered them. It was a small table, how bad could she really miss any of us? As we were about to dig in, I noticed two things: first, that the above mentioned carafe had ceased to contain coffee, and second, that my omelet was not accompanied by even the slightest trace of biscuit. Had these people been talking to my doctor? Was there some vast Dot conspiracy to deny me my daily bread? I would not stand for this! No, I would sit for it. And sit. And... you get the idea. Note to Dot: Many victual vendors have members of management pop by each table and ask if everything is okay. Look into it.Little Miss Can't Be Found eventually reappeared and I was able to flag her down and request caffeine and carbohydrates. Was that a little bit of attitude I detected? Nope, it was a whole lot of attitude.Note to Dot: If your servers are going to have an attitude, use it to your advantage. Adopt slogans like ""Service with a Sneer"" or ""Eat at Dot's. Or Don't. We really couldn't care less.""Overall, the food rated four stars and the service gets zero. I can't remember the last time I tipped this poorly, but she drove me to it even after giving her the benefit of every doubt. I hate doing that, but I encourage you all to do the same. If you are served by someone who has no business in the business, don't reward them. Gently nudge them toward another line of work so that I don't encounter them after you.Two more thoughts from my trip to Dot:1) If you can manage a to-go order from here, it might be a great experience. 2) If you plan to send your child to the Caribbean to play baseball, the Dominican Republic is a much better choice than Aruba.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,dot-coffee-shop-houston,dot-coffee-shop-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/dot-coffee-shop-houston?start=260,Brandon P.,"Aubrey, TX",61,25,1,,9/1/15,"Stopped last night and had grilled chicken w/pineapple, carrot raisin salad and greens.

Your coffee drinks are pretty much just limited to, well, coffee. In a mug. With your choice of three artificial sweeteners, sugar, and cream. Realistically, it's a diner.And as far as diners go, it's fairly OK. Serving sizes are huge, and the daily specials are generally a good call. Rolls and cornbread are very tasty (and free), and the service is serviceable.I wouldn't say anything jumps off the table as incredible--not the way some places have truly unique and memorable specialties. Unlike some other Houston-area diners, the only thing that really stands out about Dot is the number of calories you'll consume in a meal. Come hungry. Leave queasy.Pro-tip, though: generally speaking, the wait staff will let us college students order off the kid's menu. Do it. The serving sizes are actually appropriate, and it's hella cheap.

The hash browns were really crispy (the way I like them) but they had zero flavor. My husband had French toast and said it was average. Despite my disappointment I ordered a homemade dessert. I ordered strawberry cream pie, one of my favorites. (Not here it isn't.)There was no cream in the strawberry cream pie instead there were whole strawberries with gelatin.

Our waiter was having a little trouble getting our order right at first but once he got that together everything was ok. The ladies restroom however was a different story; the trashcan was over flowing and there was no soap or hand towels the whole 1-2 hours we were there (good thing we had hand sanitizer). I thought most places have people check the restrooms every hour or so but I guess they don't here; I mean they weren't even that busy. Anyway, more shocking than the condition of the restroom to me was the fact that there was only one stall in the ladies restroom which is something I would expect at a gas station or some hole in the hall type joint but from what I heard about this place it's supposed to be top notch or maybe they just meant food wise. Needless to say each time someone in our party went to the restroom there was a wait/line. I was impressed by the quality and quantity of the food but other than that I was so not impressed.

It was so terrible, the massive vaccuum that is outer space would have been more pleasant.At around 11:30 p.m. on Friday night, my BF, my roomie and I decided to go to Dot Coffee Shop. In the past, I came with some friends from work for lunch, and I brought my BF for breakfast about a week ago. The service and the food were great both times, so my BF and I figured we were treating our roomie to a pretty good late-night meal.Wrong. So very, very wrong.First off, when we came in, it was a complete fuster-cluck. The entry way was clogged with people trying to pay their bill, and the line was moving really slowly. So it took us a while to even get a number. Fine, whatever. I can't hold a busy night against a restaurant. We sat there and waited for about 20 minutes while tables were cleared and so forth--again, can't hold this against them.I can, however, hold everything that happened from the time we were seated against the waitress, the manager and maybe even the kitchen.We sat in a section of four tables, one of which was clearly just hanging out and had finished eating. It took about 10 minutes for our waitress to come by to give us menus and take drink orders. Okay, fine, whatever. It irked me a bit that she left the menus and place settings all on the far side of the table and that we had to divvy them out ourselves, but it was busy. I used to wait. I understand. She came back in fifteen minutes to get our food order. Kind of a big gap there, but my BF was still mulling the menu when she came to drop off the drinks. Clearly he needed more time.I was far less forgiving thirty minutes later when our food finally came out. My roommate's and my BF's food was hot, served in Dot's usual over-the-top sizes. Mine, however, had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for the better part of that 30-minute period. My roommate, who's a waiter, asked to speak with the manager. The manager never came, but the waitress came back. She took my plate and brought out a new one WITHIN FIVE MINUTES. Gross. I was expected to eat fried crawfish that had sat under a heat lamp for around 25 minutes? Christ, that would have been a bad case of food poisoning! No wonder it felt weird and tasted dry.We received our bill--still no manager. When we went to pay, we found out the incredibly slow cashier that had had the entry way clogged at the very beginning of our visit was, in fact, the manager that evening. My roommate talked her out of charging me for my exceptionally bad food, but I still feel pretty damned burned anyways.Dot really killed a lot of goodwill with this visit. I was thinking of forgoing another coffee shop I frequent in favor of Dot, but now I think that I may not go to Dot in the future. They seriously have one more strike.And, no, prior to this trip, I'd never had an experience this bad anywhere.","alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,dot-coffee-shop-houston,dot-coffee-shop-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/dot-coffee-shop-houston?start=280,Danielle S.,"Houston, TX",430,763,72,,1/21/10,"Though the Dot used to be a neighborhood joint, it's now owned by the Pappas Military Industrial Foodservice Complex, and unfortunately, you can tell. Everything's just a little too nicely packaged, but is a little rough around the edges in other ways--for example, when we were there on a Sunday morning, there was a massive puddle of syrup on the floor at a nearby table that never got cleaned during our visit. But hey, accidents happen?If I have two pieces of advice about the Dot, it's this: one, be patient on getting a table, or getting service, and two, order just about half of what you think you're going to eat. Portions here are GINORMOUS. I made a mistake on the latter when I first came here. I ordered a short stack of pancakes, which came with my protein of choice (bacon, natch), and seeing the sub-$2 side of hash browns, I sprung for that too. I was confronted by an absolute mountain of potatoes once the plate was brought to my table. My pancakes, likewise, were bigger than my head and I gave up halfway through. Bacon was thin and crispy, though I definitely prefer the thicker kind.And on the patience front--this place gets slammed for breakfast, slammed for lunch (especially on the weekends), slammed for latenight. Don't be too surprised if you have to wait on a table, but they'll call you when your table is ready--there are speakers outside so if you're forced into the great outdoors by the knot of people in a similar predicament, no worries. Because of all of the above, expect slow service. We weren't in a hurry when we were there last, and that was probably a good thing.It's definitely not my favorite place for breakfast--I prefer taquerias or House of Pies if we're grabbing a morning meal. But for all of its shortcomings, the Dot is one of the only 24 hour joints near BF's apartment, so we'll likely be back in future after he plays a gig somewhere in town.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,dot-coffee-shop-houston,dot-coffee-shop-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/dot-coffee-shop-houston?start=280,olivia b.,"Houston, TX",121,163,9,,1/31/10,"I have never understood why some people absolutely INSIST upon reinventing the wheel. The Dot Coffee Shop was on about a 20 minute wait at 1:30 pm for Sunday breakfast. But, I wouldn't know that because they really keep no record of how many people are ahead of you in line so they can't really give you an estimate for how long the wait is going to be. You walk in, go to the cashiers counter and they hand you a piece of paper with a number on it. So, when you're up rather than calling your name, they call your number. Oh, and the numbers are in no particular order. So, we waited about 20 minutes. No biggie though. We were sat in a large booth with comfortable seating. (I love a spacious seat.) We were quickly served by a polite if not semi forgetful waitress. After we ordered she brought out a basket of delicious warm ""biscuits"". Although I would describe them as rolls, not biscuits. I ate 1 and a half. My husband said I shouldn't fill up on bread. Although their menu does not say so, they are happy to substitute egg whites for regular eggs which makes me super happy. (I know, a biscuit and a half...well, I did eat a veggie omelet with egg whites...so it's okay.) My meal was HUMONGOUS. About half way through I told my husband I was full. He said, and I quote verbatim, ""I told you not to fill up on bread."" ""You what?"", I asked. ""You don't tell me nothin!!'"" ""Maybe I'll eat the other biscuit. just to show you who's boss.""I mean really, who does he think he is?? It was so funny I'm, still laughing about it now. Dot Coffee Shop was good, not great.

This is a pleasant place to spend an hour getting good, familiar food.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,dot-coffee-shop-houston,dot-coffee-shop-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/dot-coffee-shop-houston?start=300,Jody M.,"Houston, TX",641,24,,,6/23/09,"The Dot has been around since before I was born I think so they must be doing domething right. It's not the best food ever or anything like that, but it hits Denny's, but well worth it. It's always clean and has a very friendly staff. It's a must go place in Houston!","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,dot-coffee-shop-houston,dot-coffee-shop-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/dot-coffee-shop-houston?start=300,J. D.,"Houston, TX",60,52,21,,6/18/09,"I've heard so many great things about this little shop for years because it's been around for years, so one late night, I decided to give this place a try over IHOP and Denny's. I didn't except much exterior (small parking lot full of potholes) and interior wise because it's a coffee shop, but I did expect better food since it's apart of Pappas. My first visit, I had their chicken fried steak with country gravy and mashed potatoes. The steak, though huge, was tough, tasteless, and very greas, and the gravy tasted more like flour. I was very disappointed because I could have gone to IHOP and gotten the same thing and would've been better (and I hate IHOP). My second visit was over the weekend with a group of friends. We had just finished a late night out and was hungry and a friend really wanted to go there because they liked it. Not wanting to be a party pooper, I agreed to go.Knowing I wasn't going to like any of the food, I ordered a chef's salad. While we were waiting for our order, we were served a basket of rolls, which were kind of bland and dry. It did take longer than expected for our food to arrive, but maybe it was due to the place being a little on the full side at around midnight. My salad was something I could have made at home; torn iceberg lettuce, tomato wedges, cucumbers, and shredded cheddar cheese. There were only two choice of dressing, ranch and blue cheese which came in a small plastic cup. My companions had chicken strips and fries, and chicken strips and mozzarella sticks. I will say that the chicken strips are very good. They are fried and huge, and the fries were thick cut, fresh and seasoned well (I believe with seasoned salt). Alongside their orders were big bowls of marinara and country gravy. The portions were huge, but that's one thing I will say about Dot's, everything that's served there is huge, so you do get alot of bang for your buck and a whole lot more (like a gut... lol).My only regret though is when you go to pay at the counter before leaving, you see the different desserts that are made there daily. I will admit that I wanted a slice of their strawberry pie, banana cream, heck all of them looked very appealing. I suppose if I go to Dot's again at night, I'll stick with their desserts.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,dot-coffee-shop-houston,dot-coffee-shop-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/dot-coffee-shop-houston?start=300,Wendy T.,"Houston, TX",14,37,,,3/16/12,"Why oh why must they keep messing with this place. Probably because it's owned by Pappas. Dot is a one of a kind sort of retro throw back to the old dinners. But they keep taking away things I like about. Most recently they did a partial renovation. I was looking forward to see what improvements had been made, only to find out that they took out a whole section of booths and replace them with tables. I love booths. There are still a long row of booths near the front but the back corner of them is gone. Every meal there is huge so usually you have a full meal of take home for the next day. The specials are generous. Pot Roast and Meatloaf are two of my favorites. This is big time comfort food. This was my favorite breakfast place until they took my favorite breakfast off the menu which was the Philly Scramble. (Eggs, with diced ham, green onions and cream cheese). Order your hash browns crispy. So good that way. Silver dollar pancakes are other favorite. (must bigger than a silver dollar) They brown up a little better with the smaller size. Turkey BLT is one of my lunch favorites. Patty Melts are always good. The have salads but they are pretty basic and by the time you add the dressing you would have been better off to just go with a burger so save your salads for another place. This is not the restaurant to try and diet at. Open 7 days/24 hours but as i found out the other day, they stop serving specials at 11pm so don't come in at 1am (as i did the other day) looking for meatloaf after a night out.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,dot-coffee-shop-houston,dot-coffee-shop-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/dot-coffee-shop-houston?start=320,Joe A.,"Acworth, GA",2,17,2,,8/26/12,its ok been there few time food not the seme some times good others bad,"alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,dot-coffee-shop-houston,dot-coffee-shop-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/dot-coffee-shop-houston?start=320,Yokika H.,"Waco, TX",228,13,10,,11/21/11,i just moved here from Dallas back in Aug. for school and when i found Dot i just had to try it~~you may say why~~i'll tell you~~when i saw it--it reminded me of the truck stop cafe/coffee shops that used to be along I-35 that are torn down now~~back then the truck stops had the best breakfast in the world~~so yes i had to try it to see if it would take me back to my childhood days~~i have to say yes it did!!!!! this place is so darn awesome!!!! it took me back to the old truck stop days where you got food that took up your whole plate but didn't cost you a whole lot!!!!! their breakfast is so awesome & so i had to try the dinner/lunch food & it was just as awesome as the breakfast!!!!!! when i found out this was a Poppa resturant i then wished that we had a Dot back in Dallas!,"alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,dot-coffee-shop-houston,dot-coffee-shop-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/dot-coffee-shop-houston?start=320,Gracie R.,"Houston, TX",12,62,22,,2/6/09,After reading all these reviews I expected so much!!!

Along with fried mushroom to start out with. The fried mushroom was outstanding. When my main course came out it came out so horrible. Fried Steak was cooked right but when I started eating it taste as if the Fried Steak seem to be overdue meat. Like it been left out for 5 hours. Mac and cheese taste cold and the mashed potatoes taste as if it was used since yesterday. I was disappointed by how it tasted. I have been to this place when I was young. Everything seem to change and I think the cook have no passionate for food like they did 10 years ago.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,dot-coffee-shop-houston,dot-coffee-shop-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/dot-coffee-shop-houston?start=320,Tim B.,"Williamson, TX",2,11,1,,4/7/10,"We come to this part of Houston every new years weekend to play games with our friends. Our most popular location to eat at is the Dot. Huge portions, good southern-style cooking, copious pre-ordering bread basket. Large menu of breakfast and mostly standard diner fare with a southern flare. I like the country fried chicken though the buttermilk gravy is sweet which is different. The soup and salad is a decent choice since you get a bowl of soup and q decently large salad plus all that pre-dinner bread to eat. I don't eat dessert usually but they seem to have a good dessert selection. Downsides are that they bring margarine instead if butter with the bread and also you will definitely gain weight eating here.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,dot-coffee-shop-houston,dot-coffee-shop-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/dot-coffee-shop-houston?start=320,b g.,"Wahiawa, HI",2,44,,,10/25/07,"This review will be short because all I remember was that the food was great, prices were good, and the service was good.
