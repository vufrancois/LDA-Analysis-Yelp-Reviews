Only been here once for a late lunch, and it was amazing. I had a lobster bisque. To be totally honest, I could've done without the excess white wine, but the flavor was amazing and the experience like no other. The host and servers were very seasoned and treated us like so. The desserts are to die for! I work on the building next to the establishment and they had a lunch special that was totally worth it, so make sure to take advantage of it. The only complaint is that the food took a little longer than expected, but who cares. The experience and the desserts made up for the wait.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=0,Crystal K.,"Houston, TX",203,247,612,Elite ’17,9/26/17,"One word to describe the service, impeccable. The servers at Tony's are on top of their customer's needs and goes above and beyond. I came here for lunch during restaurant week and ordered the insalata and salmon tar tar with fries. The salad was good, but I wished I asked for the dressing to be on the side. The server prepped the salmon tar tar in front of you with an array of fresh herbs and spices. It was a bit salty, but tasted delicious nonetheless. The fries were cooked to perfection! Very crispy. I usually don't go to pricy restaurants, but I think Tony's is definitely worth trying.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=0,Donna B.,"Houston, TX",22,24,1,,9/6/17,"My husband and I and two of our oldest and dearest friends celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary, and a few months later, my 60th birthday, at Tony's. We have dined here on numerous occasions, as well as attending private fundraising events hosted here. Succinctly stated, Tony's never disappoints and always delivers the goods. Now comes the lengthy review. I just read through a number of reviews and I noticed in a number of them, even the ones that are seemingly complementary, contain strong elements of snarkiness, venturing into rude, hateful, and just plain untrue. Everything about Tony's -- the ambience, the service, the food, everything is the best of the best. It attracts all types of clientele -- the well-heeled socialite, the celebrity, the millenial, and the everyday Houstonian. Speaking as one of the everyday Houstonians, let me state emphatically that Tony Vallone makes no distinction among his patrons. Each time my husband and I dine here, we are treated exactly the same as his more monied and lofy regulars. Tony and his wife always visit our table to chat with us for a few minutes, and he greets us by name. This kind of graciousness is priceless to me.Now, for the food. Oh my stars, there are no words adequate to fully describe the care and skill that goes into the preparation of Tony's food. I like the fact that he thoughtfully incorporates a ""Texas touch"" into some of his entrees. Yes, the cuisine is Italian, but the variety of dishes served is sure to please any palate. His use of seasonings never overwhelms, the pastas are cooked properly al dente, when applicable, and his fresh pastas melt in your mouth. If you're a meat lover, you will find nirvana, I can promise you! My favorite is the Colorado lamb, cooked perfectly medium rare, and it's always tender and flavorful. My favorite fish entree is the Branzino served with a toppling of lump crab meat and a light, lemony Pinot Grigio sauce. The sides are substantial and will serve four people, easily -- things like sauteed spinach, asparagus, sinfully delectable macaroni and cheese, and the best roasted potatoes known to man. I could go on and on about the food.The service is polished, professional, knowledgeable, and warm. The Sommelier works miracles and is happy to work within whatever wine budget you may have. They always get it right. The staff is efficient without hovering, attentive without being intrusive. I have never felt as though I was being rushed to finish and leave.Yes, Tony's is pricey. But, let me assure you that the quality of the food and service, as well as the unique ambience, are well worth the cost. If you are looking for low prices and quick service, this is not the restaurant for you. But, if you are looking for a unique dining experience, look no further.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=0,Karen D.,"Houston, TX",331,238,387,Elite ’17,8/12/17,"Came here for HRW dinner. The employees there were all very hospitable, almost overwhelmingly so. Our dinner was 6:30p, and the restaurant was almost empty when we arrived, but it was about 1/3 full when we left. At the beginning, there were so many servers and busboys standing around and chatting. I felt like the server was paying overwhelming attention to us, kind of always glancing at us to attend to our every need. It was a bit too much. It's nice the water is never less than 2/3 full, but still, a bit too much to feel like he can hear every word of your conversation and see you take every bite. The food was excellent for the most part. We tried to split one order of the 3 courses b/w the 2 of us, but we were told it wasn't allowed (similar to Lucille's, in contrast to Flemings and B&B who brought me an extra plate. We're students and foodies, so we try to dine on a budget, but clearly that didn't fly well here), so we ordered trombetti (pasta with ricotta), quail lollipops, snapper, duckling, mousse, and lemon tart. The apps were good but not excellent, the entrees were both excellent, and the desserts were excellent but too small. I was admiring their truffle platter from afar, and the server brought them over to my table so I could get a pic, which was very kind of him. Even when I went to the restroom, I was escorted to the entrance, and the busboy pressed the button for the door to open automatically for me. Sure, makes you feel like royalty, but this, along with the other service points does not warrant a mandatory 20% gratuity on the bill. I probably would have tipped somewhere in the vicinity (18-21%), but it felt weird when they asked for it. My bf was NOT HAPPY b/c it was not written anywhere on the menu. Also, parking is valet only! And there's dress code.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=0,Zain R.,"Houston, TX",215,315,911,Elite ’17,8/15/17,"This was my first time dining at Tony's. I had been meaning to come here for quite some time. It has a special place in Houston because it is an hommage to surviving the oil and gas bust of the 80's. We decided to come here to try out the HRW 2017 menu. I checked the menu online and was really excited to try the Umbrian truffle risotto for the first course and I had my eyes set on the prime truffled filet for the main course. Once I arrived, I got inside and told the hostess about my reservation and she informed me that I was the first of the party to arrive. She then proceeded to take me to the dining area which I thought was absolutely beautiful. Being that it was my first time, I did not realize how intimate the seating can be for two so I asked them to rearrange the dining table for me and my dining companion as we are close friends but did not want to feel uncomfortable seated so closely to each other. Few minutes go by and then she arrives.Now that we are seated at the freshly set dinner table, the onslaught of servers, managers, busboys, and apparently a table captain started. All of this might have been greatly appreciated if they knew what was going on. One of my biggest pet peeves is when you go to a fine dining establishment and you have to wait and wait and wait to get someone to take your order. Over here, one of the first people to come to our table asked us if we would like sparkling water, or if regular was fine. We requested that we get sparkling, but it never came. And my friend had ordered a pimm's cup which tasted so sweet that she couldn't fathom another sip of it. This was around 7:15. We waited. And then we waited. Until the ice had completely melted in the glass. At this point it was 7:40 and we had to flag down someone to get our order. We requested that we speak to the manager at this point. Someone came who was not the manager but was in a suit. He did not apologize but instead asked if we would like to order. I had to contain myself because how was he possibly expecting us to order without ever getting a menu. Are people supposed to learn the entire menu before they go to a restaurant these days? I have never felt so confused and angry before. Then came another man in a suit who must have been the manager but again no apology and no need for introductions or any kind of niceties. He started boasting about how great certain items on the menu are and what we should try from the HRW menu that comes almost identical to the one on their regular menu. By this point, I had lost all interest in trying out different things and had forgotten what I wanted to order so I just went ahead and ordered whatever seemed appetizing by the time the ""captain"" arrived.For the first course, I ordered the pansoti. This dish itself is worthy of five stars and is the only reason why this place doesn't get a 1 star review. I could eat this every single day of my life and become and be happy with it. It's their in house prepared ravioli that is delicately stuffed with squash, parmesan puff, and sage essence. I am not sure if there was truffle used in the preparation of this pasta dish but it was so aromatic and light and filling all at once. I was suddenly in a good mood and beginning to forget about the 40 minute ordeal of not being able to place my order. For my second course, I ordered the snapper. It was fine. A bit overcooked in my opinion but nothing that I would have sent back. The crust on the fish was a little spongy and again nothing that was awful but it was just another minor set back in a series of setbacks where everything is supposed to fabulous. What really brought everything down to a bad experience altogether was the panna cotta which was supposed to have Tahitian vanilla bean. I am not sure what a Tahitian vanilla bean is supposed to taste like but this to me tasted like volcanic ash. It was repugnant and completely took over the entire dish that I couldn't have more than two bites. The cappuccino that I requested was an excellent palate cleanser. Will I come back again? Not on my own volition. I am not going to turn it down if someone asks me to come but maybe if I come without great expectations I would not be disappointed. Since I loved their pasta, maybe I'll come back and try that. As Julia Child said, ""How can a nation be great if its bread tastes like Kleenex?"" Thankfully, this was not a problem at Tony's. If for nothing, I will be back for their floral bread basket.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=0,Tina N.,"Chinatown, Houston, TX",190,19,54,,10/30/17,"I wish the service was a bit friendlier.

Valet is free but make sure you tip because that is the considerate thing to do. Service is spectacular! This place is somewhere you want to celebrate something or someone special. It's classy and romantic. The lobster bisque is the best I have ever had. The bread service is delightful. I got full just from the bread, so go easy on it. My main course was the snapper topped with crab meat which was ok, it lacked flavor to me. The flourless chocolate cake was good but very sweet.

When I first called, they made sure we were dressed properly. (Dress fancy : Female: Dress/ business casual Male: Long pants, jackets or button ups, closed toe shoes, no sandals, no sneakers). When I talked to the lady on the phone, they were proud to represent themselves as best authentic italian place. When we finally arrived, there were several hostess walked us to our table. Several servers were hanging around our table area, waiting to be called. I definitely felt like they were very serious with their service, and make sure we get taken care of. However when we started with drinks, we ended up waiting so long for the waiters to take our orders. Some of them actually refused to take our order because he wasn't supposed to help us.Despite of how lovely of this place was with fancy sculptures and beautiful paintings, it seemed like place was so unorganized. Its not the most spacious place, almost reminded me of hotel lobby with grand entrance with several tables. As mentioned, loved how they decorated the place with artistic works. Almost felt like we were dinning at a art museum. We enjoyed the soft music in the background, classic yet subtle.HRW menu was also presented with regular menu, and every dishes were excellent. They weren't americanized or catered towards the general public in that they were very authentic. I loved every dishes they had!! EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM!!!!With a big group of people, we were able to taste little bit of everything, although it seems to be discouraged to share foods. Every one of them were perfectly cooked, and presented with perfect demonstration with impeccable flavor. Of all the dishes I want to just point out few dishes from HRW and few of my favorite regular menu.1. Fettuccine alfredo: WASN'T WHITE! 4.5/5We always assumed Alfredo sauce was white and creamy, but this showed little bit of orange color bit of tomato flavor. Cream was just so flavorful, eating it with bread was another way to enjoy this dish. Now, the pasta though, you can tell they hand make this pasta. It was so soft and chewy. I wish the portions were larger2. Risotto de fungi: They suggested it was the best risotto in town. They had a record of winning an award for this dish and it didn't disappoint us. Definitely amazing and flavorful with mushroom and cream with aldente rice. Definitely wished it was larger portion3. WINE!: They have a wine selection called ultra violet. $90 range. It was so amazing. We ended up looking it up and you could only get it from ordering it online. I was surprised they had such a good wine lists to go well with the food. Definitely going to order this wine myself Overall I want to give 4/5: Reason for not giving them not 5 is that, their disappointing service, and overly set price despite of small portion. Tony's definitely already have its reputation for serving high quality food and what not, but wish they can improve their service.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=0,CJ Y.,"Houston, TX",12,4,49,,8/17/17,"I was skeptical when I first arrived.

It was reservation only. My gf had to make a reservation a week in advance for a big party, i don't know because it was the first week of HRW. The employees there are very welcoming, almost too many to confuse you who's is your server. We were sat around 8 pm, but I could tell all the tables were full. We were introduced with glass of water and bread sticks.Thirty min in, we still have not yet received our menu. We were confused that they weren't ready for us. We started ordering cocktails and wine bottle.I loved the open atmosphere with large paintings and sculptures in the middle of the restaurant. Everyone was dressed up, and escorted. Definitely a fancy ambiance. When we called earlier before the arrival, the lady on the phone made sure that we were dressed properly for the evening.The food was excellent.

All their dishes exceeded my expectation and enjoyed the diversity and variety. Each dish was bit too small for individual, but I'd come back to try different dishes. Later towards the dinner, gf had already told the waiter that we were celebrating our anniversary today, and they presented us with cotton candy desserts.

They weren't very good- just some chopped iceberg lettuce and some cheese. The salad we ordered was brought to us and they apologized. This one was much better. The sole special for that evening was amazing and very flavorful. My friend had the sea bass and it was equally as delicious. Both were perfectly prepared.

Also, it is valet only and the service is extremely slow - an apparent hallmark of authentic Italian food. I started with the insalata milano, which had treviso, burrata, pomegranate seeds, and blueberries. The dish was artfully arranged and very flavorful, as well as large enough that it was enjoyable but not too large to disturb the entree portion of the meal.For my entree I got the pansoti, which is a butternut squash sage ravioli. Typically this is an appetizer but you can ask for an entree portion. The portion looks small when you first receive it but is extremely rich and flavorful. I highly recommend!For dessert, my table got a chocolate caramel souffle. Tony's is known for their souffles, which they make to order with any flavors requested and are about the size of a large saucepan. It was incredible!

My wife and I came for dinner to celebrate a special occasion recently and I'm happy to say that they still got it. Interior is modern and airy, but still intimate. Not counting the private event rooms, there's probably 20 or so tables in the whole restaurant, which makes for a fairly quiet dining experience compared to other more raucous trendy spots. Regarding attire, jackets are strongly suggested for men, which I am all for, but there were a handful of younger guys without. You'd be more comfortable with one on though. FYIWe settled on the 3 course tasting menu with wine pairing, deciding to each choose 3 different dishes from the available 7, so we could taste a little bit of everything. Like most tasting menus, the portions aren't massive but you'll still be full after eating all plates. Plating was artful and most dishes were easy to attack even with the drizzle, dots and stacking of food. Everything was executed well and absolutely delicious. Lots of truffles and rich sauces which also made smaller portions fill up the stomach. I've seen that service is often a big linchpin for peoples' reviews on here and we luckily had an excellent experience. There were multiple waiters tending to our table. Also mentioned before in other reviews, the timing of service is fairly laid back, but it really is up to your preference. Their default seems to be, let the guests relax, talk and take it slow. We ordered cocktails to start prior to ordering food. They were served to our center on the table as a marker that we weren't ready to order food yet. Once we were, we simply moved the glasses over to their usual spot and nodded at our waiter. Menus came shooting out to us and off to the races. We asked the wait staff at another point to wait a beat between two dishes and service followed suit. My point being that maybe the people who complain about pace aren't aware that it's under your control if you just simply ask. Another kudos to good service came at the end of the night. We had signed the check and were just working on finishing our cocktails, obviously done with dinner. This is usually the part of the night out where the wait staff disappears on your table to never be seen again. I was happy to see the waiters still making rounds checking our table and even the water glasses were kept full while we sat there finishing up our drinks. Prices, are well, pricey. You get what you pay for and I would say Tony's is easily a top 5 Houston restaurant contender if not higher, depending on your tastes. That being said, their price point is on par with my experience eating at Michelin Star restaurants, so come ready to spend. We had 4 cocktails and both selected the 3 course tasting menu with wine pairing. The bill at the end of the night, with tip, was right around $300-ish.Tony's was one of the top fine dining restaurants in the U.S. during the 80's, but being associated to that decade of peak oil and decadence carries a double edged sword that Tony's at times has felt. Like hyper colors and pushed up sleeves on a blazer, things come in and out of fashion, including modern cuisine and white table cloth restaurants. I would argue though, that Tony's still offers a unique and delicious meal to Houston restaurant goers if you're willing to put on your Sunday best and spend a little cash. Call it an offering to the ghosts of $100 oil.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=0,Gino T.,"Houston, TX",56,284,24,,8/21/17,"Review is based on two Houston Restaurant Weeks experiences--one lunch and one dinner. My wife and five our her girlfriends had lunch on Wednesday, and arrived to a beautifully-set table, enjoyed preprandial drinks, and absolutely wonderful appetizers of Pansoti and Lasagnette. However, the entrees were a total disaster. Four of the ladies ordered the Snapper Francese; two sent it back in favor of the Salmon Tartare, and the other two ate it, complaining (as did the first two) that the fish did not taste fresh, and it tasted as though it had been reconstituted with cracker crumbs, Panko crumbs or something similar. The other two ordered the Steak salad, and the steak came out burned (not just charred) on the edges. Unlike typical Tony's typical service, no attempt was made to appease the diners--the meals were not comped, nor were any dishes offered as replacement.Saturday night, three couples dined there again using the HRW menu. The meal began with amuse bouche of a delicious ravioli (mushroom?). Our appetizers included Escargots, Roman Artichoke Salad, Rigatoni Bolognese Bianco and Pansoti, all of which were delicious.Entrees included the Grilled Abalone Mushroom, Niman Short Ribs of Beef, both of which received rave reviews, and the Halibut Prosecco, ordered by all three of the men. This dish was served bare--no decoration of any sort on the plate, so it was visually unappealing; moreover, while it had a wonderful flavor, all three of us agreed it was somewhat tough, meaning it was probably overcooked.The desserts were simply outstanding--the Italian Beauty (for the chocolate lovers), Panna Cotta with blackberry sauce (the best I've ever tasted), and Un Bacio Arancione (if you like a citrusy type dessert). The only other comment I can make is that we certainly did not receive the same service that ""regular"" diners did--our wine/liquor bill would probably have been 20-30% higher had our waiter paid any attention to us, rather than ignoring us.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=0,Lynn M.,"Katy, TX",1,57,80,,8/12/17,"I came here for lunch and had Houston Restaurant Week menu.

We have pushed him on more than one occasion to find us a bottle and he has been on point and on budget every time. We had several courses on this visit and it should say something about the food our favorite dish was an oxtail risotto. Given how many other luxury ingredients we got to enjoy, when that kind of love and attention goes into a ""budget"" dish, you have to smile. The paté which offers foie gras two ways? Excellent. The soft shell crab? Truly to die for. The staff are attentive without being either overbearing or obsequious. The decor takes some getting used to, but the longer you are there, the more sense it seems to begin to make. When they say they will do a soufflé in any favor, believe them and go for it. Near as we can tell, what they do is make a basic vanilla puff and then provide you a flavored whipped cream -- which is what you really want anyway. We did strawberry as they're locally in season right now and were delighted by a gravy boat of thick, pink cream full of firm, red fruit chunks. The soufflé itself had browned so nicely it almost smelled of ice cream cone. When we left there were three Rolls Royce and a Bentley in the car port.

When they extended Houston restaurant weeks due to that asshole Harvey I decided to bite the bullet and make a reservation. My wife and I arrived dressed to the nines in our nicer car and were greeted very professionally by the maitre d' and promptly taken to our table where she sat my wife and carefully placed the napkin on my wife's lap...off to a good start we were! Our server Jaime (as well as the rest of the staff) operated like a Swiss watch. It was almost like they could read our minds when we were in need of anything. I glanced a the empty wine glass on the sample and immediately the sommelier was there with the wine menu. We oped for the three course restaurant week menu (a bargain at 45/person). I had the Umbrian summer truffles with house made pasta, snapper francese, and Italian Beauty cake. The truffles were the epitome of decadence. They brought them out on a platter with a display dome and shaved them right over the house made pasta. The nutty earthiness of the truffles really tickled my exotic funny bone. My wife, who hates any fungi that doesn't have shamanistic qualities even liked the truffles:) I ordered the snapper francese after talking to Jaime about which main was a quintessential Tony's dish. It was impressive to say the least. The flaky snapper with the lump crab meat was lemony buttery heaven in my mouth. I am so going to try to recreate this Sunday night! The dessert was a flour-less chocolate cake with a few carefully placed puddles of raspberry sauce. I'm not a huge sweet person but I really enjoyed the rich chocolate goodness of every bit and was a perfect end to a delicious meal. We also had a side of fried Brussels sprouts and fried potatoes. I've never had a fried brussel sprout that I don't like and Tony's was no exception. The potatoes were so crisp I had to ask if they were fried multiple times. Really awesome side to order! My other half was kind enough to share her quail lollipops, short ribs and the orange sorbeto pound cake crumble. The quail was nicely presented with their delicate bones protruding but was lacking in the flavor department (I think it would have benefited from good brine). The short ribs were tender and the sauce was incredibly flavorful. The orange sorbeto pound cake crumble was a good but forgettable. Overall we had a great meal at Tony's.

We went with another couple on a Friday night, and even though we had reservations, the place was pretty much dead. The space itself is unusual. Located at the bottom of an office building, the interior is surprisingly open with tall ceilings, which make it look even emptier than it really is. Let's just say I wouldn't use the words ""intimate"" or ""cozy"" to describe the space. Nevertheless, the quality of food and service is exactly what you'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber. There's no rush to order or move your meal along, because it seems like the kinda place that really wants you to enjoy the experience. If you share an appetizer (as we did with several dishes), they actually split every dish and plate it for the individual diner, which I thought was a nice touch. We started with the tuna tartare and burrata with prosciutto, both of which were fabulous! We loved every bite and probably could have used a few more. We also started with an order of the pappardelle, which was also very small in portion but perfect when split between 4 people.For my main course I got the branzino, which was also fantastic. It was crispy on the outside, flaky on the inside, and had the perfect lemony buttery tartness you'd expect. It was an excellent dish! Every Houstonian foodie should experience Tony's once. Make an evening out of it (our reservation was at 7:30 and we didn't get home til almost 11!) and enjoy the variety of dishes with a group. I don't need to go back anytime soon, but I'm certainly glad I can cross this one off my Houston restaurant bucket list.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=20,Hashim A.,"Houston, TX",112,214,61,Elite ’17,11/19/16,"The rumors of Tony's demise have been greatly exaggerated.

I finally ended up going for my birthday and I could not have asked for a better dining experience. Some people say it's too snobby and complain that you have to wear a suit jacket. I get it but I think Tony's is a great spot for a special occasion or whenever if you're a baller. We had reserved the salt dome red snapper which is an experience in of itself. You have to order this dish at least 24 hours in advance and it's available as an appetizer or main course for two or more people. They take a whole red snapper, enclose it in a dome made out of salt, and cook the fish in the salt dome. They then bring the fish to your table on fire, I'll be uploading a picture so you can see what i mean. After a couple seconds, they smother the flames and use a mallet to break through the salt dome. From there, they pick out the best pieces and serve it to you along with a nice sauce and some asparagus. I was worried the snapper would be too salty since it was cooked in a salt dome and everything but this wasn't the case. It was tender and flavorful. The service was also impeccable. We were given salad and sweet corn ravioli on the house. They also brought me some cotton candy with a sparkler as a birthday dessert. The dining area is stunning and filled with modern art. Parking is valet only unless you are able to find some parking on the street. Several of the folks at Tony's wished me a happy birthday.

Boy did he rise to the occasion in finding this place. When we pulled up we saw a Rolls Royce, Bentley, and 3 Mercedes, so I knew immediately the kind of crowd that would be inside. Luckily, they had told us the strict dress code when making the reservation, so we were ready to go.We valeted the car, and walked inside and the restaurant was absolutely beautiful. Atmosphere (5) for sure. We were seated in a small table in the corner that was so far from another table that it almost felt like our own little section. I really appreciated that layout.Onto the food/drinks...we had scoped the menu before coming, so I was already super excited:Cracker/bread starter (3) - This was waiting for us as we came in, and I wasn't a huge fan of most of the crackers, but I'm a bread gal, so this didn't come as much of a surprise. It was nice to have something right awayCocktail list - It has no prices...Maybe it's just me but I found that super odd. I'm not writing you a blank check for a cocktail no matter how much I have in my wallet, but my boyfriend really liked his drink and it was I believe $14 when the bill came, so not completely insane.Wine list (4) - Extensive with Italian options that unfortunately I knew nothing about, so I picked a less expensive Napa Cab. They had a wide range of price options, which I appreciated, and I think most wallets can find something here for you.For appetizers we got: tonno crudo (5) and mediterranean langoustine (5) - NOMS. Tonno crudo was a very sizable portion of tuna in a simple glaze, but it was simply delicious. My langoustines were simply broiled, but they were unreal. They came right out of the shell and were mouthwateringly good. They came 2 split open for 4 halves, and I would've licked the plate if that wouldn't have been frowned upon.Around this time they brought out the real bread, and OMG get the focaccia. I don't care if you don't even like focaccia (is that even possible?), but seriously you must give it a try. We may have asked for seconds....Dinner: Center cut filet (truffled prime) (5) and mediterranean branzino (4). My boyfriend's filet came with truffled mashed potatoes that the waiter also offered to let me try, but I just stole some of my boyfriend's and WOW. If you like truffle, you must get this dish. the filet was as good as Pappa's - and that's saying something. The branzino was totally fileted, which I loved. I did wish the fish had a little more ""pop"" to it in order to be a 5, but I really enjoyed it, especially since it's harder to find this dish in Houston.Sides - creamed spinach (5) & truffled mac (5). These are both worth getting. I loved them, and I'd definitely get them again. Their mac is certainly top notch.Dessert we tried the famous chocolate souffle. Honestly it was a 3 for me. I just don't think I'm a souffle person though. It was soft and the presentation was great, but it was just very airy and doughy and I like my chocolate fudgey and dense like mousse. At $15 a person, this was too steep to repeat but worth trying for sure if you're into souffles.I can't wait to return, so I highly suggest you save up and give this place a try.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=20,Laura G.,"Houston, TX",39,254,109,,3/12/17,"Happy Hour?

Reservations can easily be made over the phone on weekdays from 10am-6pm (no online resys at this place). Dress code is strict and reiterated over the phone- jackets required for men. This restaurant is located in the Greenway Plaza area and tucked away with the other businesses on Richmond Ave- definitely not a place you would notice if you drive down Richmond regularly. They only have valet parking available so make sure to bring some cash for tip. Upon walking in, and based on other friends' review of this restaurant, I expected it to be super classy, even snobby...but it was quite the opposite IMO. We came mid week for dinner and the place was half full. Walking in, it seemed very business-like and modern- not romantic at all. Definitely not a place I thought I would share an intimate birthday dinner with my husband. The dining area is wide open with somewhat bright lights. Luckily the tables weren't too close together, thus is was not very noisy. Once the hostess walked us to our table, our chairs were pulled out and our drink order was immediately taken. Unfortunately, no one offered us a drink/wine menu- the waiter just asked us what we wanted to drink. Not sure if there was a cocktail menu but luckily we have a regular cocktail we usually start with so that wasn't a problem. Their wine menu was given to us upon our request and is very extensive. We shared a bottle of red with our meal and it was full-bodied and went well with what we ordered.After ordering and receiving our cocktails we waited a good 10 minutes or so for anyone to come by our table and offer us menus to look at. If you're gonna make us wait that long, at least leave the menus at the table for us to look at! That was a major negative to me about this place. Why wouldn't you leave your menu at the table if I specifically came to a restaurant to EAT?! SOOO strange.My husband and I picked a couple of items to share together: - We got the Foie Gras appetizer to start with as well as one of their salads- both good enough to devour in 5 minutes but not memorable enough to remember how it tasted or even which salad we ordered.- Pappardelle Bolognese: Yumm!! The pasta noodles were soft and delicious and the meat sauce was delightful!- Tagliata: This prime ribeye was cooked to our order preference- medium rare, pink, and tender. It was very tasty and I am glad we tried it but truthfully I've had equally good/better steaks in Houston.- Truffled mac & cheese: The perfect side to go with our meat! Cheesy and tasty...you really can't go wrong with anything truffled.- Chocolate soufflé: We shared this for our dessert and it was rich and delicious. Great for chocolate lovers!!! - Cotton candy: When I made our reservation I mentioned to the hostess that it was for my husband's birthday so this dessert automatically came out with a sparkler and served on a Happy Birthday plate. Great touch and who doesn't love cotton candy?!Overall, based on service and food I would love to come back and try the other dishes on their menu.

This is a date spot to wine and dine your main chicks; you definitely don't take your side piece here unless you have DEEP pockets. I mean, there's an $85 steak on the menu. I found two sufficient reasons to finally check out Tony's- Houston Restaurant Weeks and a surprise celebration for J's birthday. J gives me credit for upgrading his once pitiful wardrobe. Not so long ago, he lived in tall tees, basketball shorts, and the ultimate fashion faux pas- socks with mandals. Now he's blending in with old money patrons. I never thought I'd live to see the day. We were seated at a round table, which was appreciated. So much easier to converse without having to shout across, and every seat is optimal. We ordered off of the HRW menu and splurged on some extras. Duck, risotto, ahi tuna- classic and understated. I like that they know when to pull back; things don't necessarily taste better as you add more and more expensive ingredients to it. My new BFF was the only one who'd been to Tony's before (her dad actually built the restaurant- what a boss), and she said the chocolate souffle with Grand Marnier is a must. She's never wrong. Totally worth the $8 surcharge, especially considering the HRW desserts (praline cheesecake and tuxedo chocolate cake) were laughably small. They were the size of my pinky. That's like the amuse bouche before my real dessert. Our server presented J with cotton candy and a sparkler, which was nice. Apparently, at really fancy restaurants, they hold your leftovers at the hostess stand for you to pick up on the way out. Don't be that clown (me) asking the whereabouts of your leftovers. Bottom line: the restaurant looks lavish, but the food was just okay.

After taking in a show, we had a wonderful dinner at ""Tony's on 09/2015. I'm a native of Brooklyn, NY so my taste can be choosy.It is a very upscale restaurant in Houston. The kind that caters to very classy people. So my wife fit in perfectly and I fit in like a gorilla in a suit. They apparently served multiple presidents before and some of them may have actually been good ones too! Honestly I never felt so pampered. I've been to upscale places before but topped them all. I was talking to my wife at the table. I was telling her a story about work and I wouldn't stop talking. Then my wife told to me to be quiet because I noticed at the corner of my eye the waiters were standing behind me with the menu ""patiently"" waiting for me to finish talking, waiting for a break in my conversation so they could hand us the menu. It seemed like they were standing there for a good couple of minutes just waiting for us to stop talking. Good thing our 5 year old wasn't there or they'd still be there waiting for him to stop.We had a couple of waiters and a captain. I never had a captain. But apparently he's the guy who makes sure everything is served to your liking, explains everything and hovers over us helping the waiters, etc. He's like the ""capo"" of the Italian restaurant in our designated area. I also suspect that he is there to make sure that if we don't pay, he ""makes us an offer we can't refuse"". You don't mess with the capo!Throughout the night, my glass of water was never less than half empty. I tried! I wanted to challenge these people. But I couldn't get it half empty! Because if it ever dared to get half empty a waiter ran up and filled it without me asking. When meal came, the waiters brought the meal, served it to us, took the side dishes and began putting some of the sides right onto our plates for us. One by one. God forbid I have to do this myself! The food (ribeye steak, lambchops, truffles,etc) was cooked to perfection! Best I ever had. For dessert we had Grand Marnier Soufflé. The flavor wasn't on the menu. Captain just said, ""choose the flavor."" I'm thinking (chocolate, strawberry, vanilla). My experience with flavor comes from Breyers ice cream. She's like... um... we shall have ""Grand Marnier Souffle"" And she said it with authority. So I knew it must be good. And I said ""Oh yes lovey, I shall have that same thing.""I didn't use the bathroom facilities. My wife did. She says that every stall in the bathroom has it's own personal sink for each individual person. She did say that the water pressure was a bit low for the individual sinks so for that I have to say... ""This is disgraceful. I have never been so insulted in my entire life! And you call yourself a restaurant!""In conclusion , because the water pressure was a little low in the individual sinks unfortunately, that kind of ruined the evening for us at the end. And because of that, my wife and I will NOT be coming back to this restaurant anytime soon. MAYBE we'll come back for some special occasion or have dinner from time to time. But this low water pressure will ensure that we will NOT be regular visitors. The 320.00 dollar bill is not a key factor in this decision at all. It's the water pressure. I swear. Tony really outdid himself. I have eaten at many fine restaurants in NY and Houston. (McDonalds, Wendy's, KFC). No seriously. I've eaten at fine French, Italian, Turkish and various Ethnic cuisines, mid range and high range. And Tony's very much impressed me not only with their top notch service but excellent food. Truffles were great. I highly recommend. Thank you for a wonderful time, and now that we've moved practically across the street we're now in walking distance.

The server had it in a decanter so it was able to breathe until we decided to start drinking it.Appetizers:Mussels: I'm not a fan of mussels but the rest of the table said that they were the best they ever had. Very flavorful and tasty was what was said.Gnocchi -- I usually don't like gnocchi but it was amazing here. If all gnocchi tasted like this, I would get it all the time! It was not a shareable plate -- only 4 pieces with an order.Proscuitto appetizer: I don't remember the name of this appetizer but it had proscuitto with cheese and melons. I am a bit biased because I had this in Italy back in 2007 so this wasn't as good but still pretty good.Ahi Tuna appetizer -- my parents said it was tasty and fresh. Next time, I think I'll order one of the pastas to try for an appetizer.Dinner:Lamb: Many juices and nicely sliced for the personSea Bass: Mmmm I think this one was my favoriteAhi Tuna -- Not my favorite. I love ahi tuna so I was a little disappointed but all the other food was good.Sides:Spinach: I Love spinach and theirs was just as good as other places.Truffle Mac n Cheese: It was okay. Next time, I'll try something else. The cheese was a bit too creamy and thick for me. Desserts:Chocolate souffle: It's not my favorite so I don't think you should consider my review if you LOVE this dessert. This is my moms's favorite and she absolutely loves it so I would go for it if you always order it. The large size is enough for 4 people, if not more.Banana Foster sundae -- I ordered this because of a picture I saw on Yelp :) TASTY!!

I called in advance to make sure that wasn't going to be a problem and I was assured that would be okay. When we arrived, we were seated promptly and I asked who I thought was our server if I could get the tasting menu and everyone else would order different dishes. He assured me that would be okay. Come to find out, that wasn't our server and we have a ""captain"" who would be taking our order. He then told me I could not order that way. One of the big reasons I wanted to go in the 1st place was to get the tasting menu and to be told by 2 different people I could and then finally to be told I couldn't was very disappointing. Regarding the food, it was okay at best. The one thing I was impressed with was the Foie Gras. The steak, the fish, the salad, the soufflé just wasn't that impressive. I was really excited to try some of their pasta being that they make it there. Some how, it was very dry and dull. Maybe we can on an off-night but the meal was very underwhelming. Lastly, this isn't really the fault of Tony's, but as I have gotten older, the pretentiousness of a restaurant doesn't impress me anymore.

Pretty decent and well dressed crowd, even on a Monday evening. We were the only group without jackets, although a similar group arrived later.Excellent arrangement of grissini, Parmesan crisps and toasts arrive with a tiny dollop of oil and a generous potion of butter, enlivened with what I thought were truffle shavings, but turned out to be black lava salt. Delicious. It is replaced twice even though we had not finished it. Generous, if a bit extravagant. My host picks a nice bottle of chardonnay, possibly the Phelps, I didn't get a good look.A bit of semantic confusion - my host asks the waiter if the halibut is a steak or filet. The waiter says it's a filet but like a steak. To my mind this makes no sense - either it's a halibut steak on the bone, or a boneless filet. My host plumps for it anyway. He chooses the starter of a cold antipasto. I go with the orecchiete and our other colleague chooses the artichoke appetizer.An amuse bouche of mushroom tea with a bit of almond arrives. Somewhat pointless.The orrechiete with baccala arrive quickly and I realize they are fresh pasta, delicate in a creamy sauce, but a small portion for an appetizer, more of a tasting menu portion. The cold antipasto is lovely to look at, prosciutto, wrapped around what I took to be burrata and figs, but small for an antipasto. The tower of artichoke (insalata ortolano) is the best portion.We are offered delicious breads, a marvelous focaccia and what I thought was explained as pumpkin bread, moist and sweet like a date nut bread.I order a glass of Danjean Berthoux pinot noir ($16) to have with my tagliata. A cutting board arrives, and soon after the steak itself - it's a good sized rib steak, not a fiorentina. The steak is sliced and plated with a tiny scattering of grilled radicchio. The balsamic sauce is one of the better uses that has been made of that condiment. The wine pairs nicely.My host's halibut arrives, a filet of about 6-7 ozs. in a cream sauce. Our colleague goes for the Chilean sea bass. We share a small side of asparagus.The steak is aged to perfection and there is little fat for a rib steak, perhaps it was trimmed away in the slicing. I thought it was superior to the last great rib steak I had, at Joe's in Chicago, but at $68 it was a good bit more expensive. The only disappointment was the rib bone. I believe that the steak had been portioned so that the bone was split between two servings, and the small bone got cold while I ate the slices of meat. My colleagues seemed please with their fish entrees.I eschew dessert, being full and having spent on the steak. My host goes for a panettone french toast, our colleague opts for the tuxedo cake. Both arrive in large portions, atoning for what has come before. Their eyes are bigger than their stomachs. I am forced to share. The panettone toast is delicious, but would serve better as a brunch option. The cake is generous in a size, like something offered by a Jersey diner, but much higher quality. There's enough for my colleague, more than I wanted to eat, and a large piece leftover to bring home for his better half.Espresso is on point, accompanied with a nice almond biscotto.Four different petit-fours is offered - so we each have to try something unique. Pretty sure mine was a tiny key lime tart.Expensive, good service, good food, but larger apps and smaller desserts would make for better balance.

I can say they did not hold up to that standard. Tony does have valet which is very fast and friendly. We attended Tony's on a Saturday night, we did not even get menus as we waited for any type of service which started the trend for the slow service we did received. Also some of the menu items we learned later are charged more when ordered for dinner such as the the fettuccine and pappardelle bolognese which were more than the listed dinner menu prices. When asked about this on our check, they said that was lunch menu prices. We did attended during HRW, not everyone order the preset menu. We order from the dinner menu, we started with the Seared Sonoma Fois Gras, which in my opinion was very petit for the price. The price was $34 and I have had much better ones from Pappas Steak house or Les Mistrel. For the main course we had the Tagliatelle which is the 20 oz 55 day aged prime ribeye. The steak itself was cooked well and presentations was nice with table side slicing of the steak. They forgot to bring my side order of Truffled Mac and cheese so we had to wait for that after our steak was already sliced and getting cold. Again compared to the same food at other restaurants, Tony's did not satisfy my pallet. The steak was nicely Seared but did not leaving me wanting more, the truffled mac and cheese was not anything that I would order again. Throughout our meal, the waiters were very unattentive and not around much. The bus boys were a lot more pleasant then the actual servers. Very disappointed by the service for a place with such high reveiws. For dessert we had the chocolate souffle which was maybe the best thing about our dinner as the other food was a bit of a disappointment for me. This will be my first and last time I will be joining Tony's restaurant, I was not impressed by the service nor food for the prices. If Tony's is going to participate in HRW they should expect that all different walk of life will attend their establishment. The service should be consistent whether or not it's HRW or not.

When my boyfriend told me we were going to Tony's for Valentine's Day, I was delighted! I read each of the many, many glowing 5 star Yelp reviews for dish recommendations. But last night was not at all what I had expected. We were seated right away, but all of the tables had been turned longways along the banquette so that we were sitting on the banquette next to each other instead of across from each other. (I guess they could fit more tables with this set-up.) Nothing says romance like gazing into...the back of someone else's head? -1Wine list: very pricey - the vast majority of the bottles were 3 or even 4 digits. The sommelier was friendly and helpful even though we were clearly at the low end of the list. We ordered a bottle of Altrovino (a Tuscan blend) which was delicious. +1First course: I ordered the Fettuccini with sausage and crab meat. It was good, but way too salty, and I like salty food. Boyfriend ordered the Carmelli (I think?) which was a lot like tortellini. I don't think either of us were wowed. Our food came out immediately and had clearly been pre-made and sitting under a warmer. -1Second course: I ordered the Astice salad. WTF (the W in this case is Who) thought that would be a good idea? It was like a mismatch of ingredients all over the place. The dressing was good and the salad overall had a fresh taste but I made a huge error in ordering that. Boyfriend ordered the lobster bisque which was amazing! I should have taken one bite of my salad and sent it back to exchange for the bisque. -1/ +1Main: I ordered the braised short ribs which were the highlight of my meal. The ribs were pull apart, melt in your mouth tasty. And the 3 parmesan noodles on top were full of cheesy goodness. Yum! I did wonder about plating. My tiny portion of meat (which was ok because with all the bread they kept giving us I was getting quite full) came on a gigantic plate which had a giant green skidmark running horizontally across it. Curious.... Boyfriend had the lamb filet which was tasty, but sort of forgettable in my opinion. +1Dessert: We did not have a choice of dessert and each received bite sized pieces of cheesecake, chocolate something, and key lime tart. The key lime tart was delicious - the others were not. +1/-1Service: the waiter to table ratio was very high but there were too many service people running around and rushing. We were the second seating of the night (7:30) so knowing that there was a 9:15 seating had the staff trying to get us out of there as quickly as possible. At one point they took away my silverware and I was still eating my salad. The guy was gone before I could stop him. Also, I guess we were seated along a busy walkway, but the service people were literally running by and at one point knocked over my glass of water (but didn't notice). Luckily it was water, not wine, and fell the other way and not on us! -1Atmosphere: Nothing says romance like rock n' roll, right? Wrong. Whoever was put in charge of the music and lighting should be fired. Valentine's Day is all about romance. Why didn't they have dim lighting, soft jazz playing, candles or flowers on the tables? Instead it was bright, loud, and business-like. - 1I understand that this was a busy night for Tony's, but when you charge that much for a meal, you should deliver excellence all around. Maybe instead of being greedy and trying to squeeze as many people as possible into the restaurant, you should focus on creating a superb and memorable experience for fewer customers who will be likely to return and recommend you. This is not the place to go for Valentine's Day.

I'm just disappointed how our specific experience was managed. ...So if you DO decide to dine here for HRW, just be warned at the possibility of something like this occurring. (My gf dined there the following day and had a very similar experience.) I'm not a snob - by any means - when it comes service, but this was a bit much. It's like, ""step it up. This is Tony's.""Anyhow, despite this, I'd come back to Tony's ... buuuuut for a more typical experience outside any dining promo. Maybe a weeknight, too. Oh, and the food? I enjoyed the starters, raviolini and risotto, but the chicken entree, I would never order again.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=80,Vino U.,"Houston, TX",0,10,,,1/5/16,"The food was outstanding but the service was not so great.I really enjoyed every dish my girlfriend and I ordered.

HRW.I've become wary of going to fine dining restaurants during HRW, the concern is two-fold. 1) the restaurant pumps out about the same ole thing and in high quantities (mostly not the dishes they are known for) and 2) snooty service.Unfortunately we experienced #2 to a highly unpleasant degree that I had to take away 2 stars from what could of been a 4 star place.Plan to spend a lot more than $45 to experience the menu because there were a lot of items on the menu that can only be had with an up-charge. The food itself was not bad, but not close to the best I've ever had in Houston either. I'm not going to get into the food as it is the standard HRW fare.For the service, I just want to say that the busboys were a lot more attentive and jolly than our actual head waiter. Our water was always filled and they attended to our requests when the waiter did not want to make himself seen. Our waiter was a big snooty snobbist. From asking several times for missing items to misplacement of peoples orders to giving attitudes on questions... he really should not be working there. One dessert cake was garnished with a chocolate twist decor that crumbled during transport (looked quite hideous). Now, any right minded chef/waiter would of sent that dish back to the kitchen for presentation, but instead, we got a response like this ""the souffle was too big"". OH?! No sh*t Sherlock, how about bringing it out on a separate tray?Last time I checked, I was eating at a high-end $$$$ restaurant. If you don't want to work HRW, when your establishment is doing it for a good cause, then go take it up with your managers, not the patrons!","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=100,Kathryn N.,"Houston, TX",19,25,38,,5/13/15,"maybe I'm just too spoiled with good foods but I wasn't really impressed with this expensive dinner.. Nice place, but service could be better. Is it just me or is it strange that u HAVE TO ASK for a menu?? They sat us down, took our drinks order, n just left us to sit there. I was so confused, am I in a different world of dining where u don't get a menu until u ask for it? about 10-15 minutes later when the waiter see us all lost, he finally asked if we're ready for the menu.. this have never happened to me before, is it bcuz i've never been to a ""fine"" establishment like this? very doubtfully, since fine dining is my life! Also, I didn't like the fact that u HAVE TO ASK for bread or else, YOU DON'T GET IT. They have different kinds of crackers n butter on the table when u arrive but I really love bread.. and I didn't know they offered bread until I see the table next to us get some from the servers. The bread was soooo soft n good but it's like bread was a well kept secret for their regulars or something!FOOD WAS VERY SLOW! we got there around 7:30, ordered as soon as we got the menu, waited sooooo long for each tiny plate to arrive. I guess we r the type that likes to eat fast, and I ALWAYS order at least 6 things whenever I go eat anywhere bcuz i like variety.. but it was VERY slow in between courses.. we didn't finish until 10!Giving them 2 stars bcuz they did have the BEST ravioli ever! The pasta was perfectly chewy n soft n the sauce was rich, buttery n aromatic! I will come back for the pasta.. The white truffle soufflé was good but TOO cheesy with a strange gamy taste that I'm sensitive to, maybe it was the cheese that they used. My truffles cravings was satisfied, I was still burping up truffles 5hrs later but that's not necessarily a good thing.. The dessert in the egg with white truffles was amazing! I ordered 7 dishes (lamb chops, white truffle soufflé, foie gras, tuna medallions, ravioli, white truffle egg dessert, oysters) I only liked the ravioli and the dessert thing, for the first time in my husband's life, he couldn't even finish his foie gras even though it costed $37, and I couldn't finish the truffle souffle that costed $40, such a fail for almost $300 worth of food.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=100,Jessica R.,"Houston, TX",42,10,14,,10/15/14,"Very nice place.

So, I chose to visit Tony's with a few friends for HRW on this past Saturday evening; however, we walked out very, very disappointed. *sad*The valet service was prompt, and the hostess was friendly and welcoming. We had a reservation for 9:00PM but were not seated until 9:25PM; that was fine. Once seated, a pretty fancy looking bread basket was on the table already, but the bread (of various kinds) were not fresh at all (stale and non-crispy). We waited a while for someone to finally stop by our table for take drink orders. Then, we waited a little bit more but still no menu was presented....*frustrated* Eventually i had to stop this manager-looking guy, who had passed by our table a few times, to ask for some menus. He dropped off the menus and apologized for the delay, but then we said we were there for HRW and would like to see the HRW Dinner Menu. UH-OH! Quality of service started to go down from this point.....because of the HRW ""inexpensive"" menus maybe?! *sighs* During the 2-hour period we were at the restaurant, the four of us had no idea who our waiter was, or perhaps there was not even a waiter assigned to our table! Every time we needed something, we had to stop whoever passing by and ask....Grrrrrrrrrr!! Would you call that Service?? Nah. I dont think so....NONE! NO SERVICE WHATSOEVER!! WHERE'S OUR WAITER?! (Well.....Gotta give some credit to the busboys and bread person; they were polite and prompt in service)On the foods....eh. Everything tasted A-Okay; just a tad too salty in some dishes. Raviolini was good, and so was the Salmon entree. The caviar and gold flakes on top of the salmon filet definitely made it look nice and fancy! The BF's ""cernia"" (red snapper) was pretty tasty as well. However, the beef tartar and the chicken/ sausage entree were just alright. For desserts, the souffle was really really yummy, and totally worth the $8 extra! I liked the lemon souffle better than the chocolate one. Elizabeth's cheesecake was, again, just alright and not impressive. Most tables had the cotton candy (upon guest request) which looked cute; we didn't request any cotton candy though as we were busy enough with finding our waiter, if there was actually one.Anyways, i would not recommend Tony's for RW.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=100,Sue P.,"Sugar Land, TX",196,207,254,,2/15/14,"Okay, this post Valentine's Day dinner, I now have a new favorite desert!

The price was $95 per person, which seems on par for what I would expect to spend on this holiday. On any other day, though, I would have thought that for what we got, $95 each would have been significantly overpriced. First, when they brought us to our table, it was obvious that they had brought in extra tables just for the occasion, and ours was one of those. Normally, this would be perfectly acceptable to me. However in this case, the table legs were such that it made it virtually impossible to sit next to each other at our round table, as the table was set, so we had to do some rearranging and sit across from each other instead. It was ok, but it would have been nicer and more romantic if we had not had that issue. The service was excellent throughout the whole evening, well done. We started out with the bread basket and two types of butter, one of which had truffle on top. Nice touch. The first course: I got some tuna tartare which was very yummy. Raw tuna with an Asian soy sauce thing. My husband got some ravioli which was very very good as well. The second course my husband had the primavera salad and it was also excellent. I had the grilled baby octopus and it was not good at all. There was some sort of flavor that I didn't like. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be that way or not. It was very very smoky and something else that I can't quite describe.The main course was duck with risotto and cherry sauce for my husband. This was also excellent, as was my fish. My fish was Sea Bass lightly fried with mushrooms and a delicious sauce. Lastly, dessert was tasty as well. A trio of small desserts. All in all, I was happy with our dinner.

With my unhappy self, I couldn't help it but to show them my frustration. After the manager noticing my frustration, the service surprisingly picked up and they were on top of everything. To make up with everything, the chef sent out some complimentary desert which was something we appreciated. If they didn't give any effort on making it up to us, I would probably give them a two star. Their food, on the other hand was delicious and their macaroni and cheese was good.

I went with a friend on New Year's Eve 2012/13, after she told me that Tony's was a Houston NYE tradition. The price tag was expensive, but I am generally willing to pay more for truly fine dining, so went into the evening with a sense of excitement and justifiably high expectations.The evening got off on the wrong foot when we were seated at an awkwardly located table all the way in the back of the restaurant. The table was effectively located adjacent to the serving/staging area, so that we sat amid the rush and bustle of the understandably busy waitstaff. It was hectic and virtually impossible to relax and have a private conversation. Hurried waitstaff stepped on my toes more times than I can recall. The room was also intermittently drafty, which is a small point but added to the overall negative atmosphere.The service was, considering the pressure of NYE, adequate, with two exceptions. First, my dining companion asked for a glass of wine with her entree. The entree arrived, but the wine didn't. She politely reminded the waitstaff about the drink, wanting to enjoy her wine alongside the entree. The wine eventually came, but so much later that by the time it arrived, the entree was cold. Second, I did not see anything I wanted from the pasta course, so asked if I could substitute a second selection from the soup/salad course instead. The waiter told me that I would have to pay a surcharge for that. Obviously this is their restaurant policy, but if I had a patron who wanted to make a small change and was paying as much as Tony's charges for NYE dinner, I'd accommodate the request free of charge as a courtesy in the interest of good customer relations.The food itself was quite good, though not nearly enough to warrant the exorbitant price tag. My salad was sub-par: The greens were not very fresh and had too much oily dressing. On the other hand, my truffle filet was well-cooked and flavorful. My dining companion enjoyed her meal, including the duck, but we both agreed we'd had much better food elsewhere in Houston. I know that New Year's is a challenging time for popular restaurants like Tony's. I think the waitstaff and kitchen did their honest best to do a good job. Despite that, the result of those efforts fell well short of what I reasonably hoped for given the substantial price tag associated with NYE dinner at Tony's. This is, of course, only my experience. Your mileage may vary.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=120,Charles H.,"Houston, TX",0,196,8,,1/2/16,"My wife and I plus another couple had dinner here New Years Eve...this was the first visit for my wife and I...when the reservations were made we were told it was a set menu, the cost is 95.00 per person...I ask what was on the set menu (she didn't know) so I asked if it was posted online, she said no...I asked how we could find out, she said only the chef knew...I could tell by her tone she didn't want to find out or continue the conversation.

I thought the experience overall was pretty good, but there are definite areas for improvement. And yes, the dinner did burn a hole in my wallet.We started with ordering a bottle of wine with the sommelier's help - he was great and very helpful. We got the Duemani Altrovino, which was fantastic and thankfully not insanely expensive.For the first course, she got fettuccine and I got a dish called caramelli - I liked both, and thought mine was very good. It was rich and cheesy. Excellent.Second course: She got the crab and lobster salad, which was so-so. It was all fresh, but just wasn't exciting.I got the lobster bisque, with a little sherry added. Really, really good.Third course:She got the braised beef short ribs while I got the filet mignon of lamb. Her dish edged mine out slightly, but I was still happy with my lamb, perfectly cooked to medium. For dessert, we each received the plate with a mini key-lime pie (great), chocolate mousse/cake thing (okay), and cheesecake (pretty good).Service seemed a bit rushed; it was often hard to catch someone's eye to get more water, but we got a lot of bread. Weird. I was also not a big fan of the table set-up. We were seated against a wall, seated together on the bench with the table pushed in. It made for a good view of the dining room, but I was sorta hoping to watch my date the entire night, not waiters rushing to and fro.Music: The biggest negative. It ranged from horrible rock music to horrible dance/pop/disco, or something like that. The music was too loud and horrific.It totally clashed with whatever 1) Tony's should be about and 2) what Valentine's Day at Tony's should be about. Basically, it ruined the mood and ambiance. Tony's: remember the name Bill Evans, download his jazz albums, and play them softly.

I have not met him but via e-mail he assured me my server would grant my request.From the beginning, Ms. Donna Vallone approached our table and greeted me and my guest. How delightful and unexpected. But aside from Ms. Vallone's special touch, our server was ready for us--no need to wonder when anyone was going to help.We were not made to rush, so we took our time ordering.Our meals were superb, and throughout our meal, our server and others, including Mr. Vinny Montecuollo, checked on us to make sure all was well and we were enjoying our meals. I enjoyed the seared sea bass; and my guest, the tuna tartar, both from the lunch menu.After our lunch, my guest and I sat and conducted business. She departed, and when it was time to pay our bill, I discovered I did not have my billfold. I had no ID, only my word that I would pay my bill. I was distressed and disclosed this fact to the individual who handed me my check. He nonchalantly stated that sometimes that happens. He asked I wait a moment, so he could apprise his superior about the matter.Mr. Vinny Montecuollo approached me and, without hesitation, set me at ease by telling me to take breath, to relax. I verbally gave him my address, but that didn't matter. He asked for my phone number and told me to drive home carefully; then to call in a credit card number. His kindness and consideration floored me. Who am I? A stranger who walked in to have lunch at this elegant establishment.I calmed down and sat and thought for a moment. I remember being on a trip and taking a picture of the cards (including my ID) I would be carrying in my pocket for the day. I perused my photos and discovered I had a picture of the card I wanted to use to pay for the meal. I proceeded to write it onto a piece of paper and handed it to the gentlemen who was responsible for collecting my payment.Done.But I truly, truly appreciate that Mr. Montecuollo proved to me that accepting one's word alone to complete a business transaction (gentlemen's agreement) is still alive today.Thank you ever so much.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=120,Emily L.,"Houston, TX",68,34,48,,8/23/14,The food was good but be aware the menu price doesn't match the final price.

""we're not River Oaks kind of people but we wore nice clothes to dinner at Tony's and were surprised that how well they treated regular Joe's like us""). C'mon folks- why be intimidated by people whose job it is to ""wait"" on you? In other words, they work there. You don't.Anyhoo, given that it was Houston Restaurant Week and I'd never been here before, I rounded up some girlfriends for a Friday night dinner at Tony's. After we were seated, at least 4 waiters swarmed around to place napkins in our laps, offered an assortment of breadrolls, asked us what we'd like for an aperitif, told us the truffle special of the evening, etc... When one of my friends ordered a $20 glass of Veuve Cliquot, the frenzied circling of our table increased until..... DRUMROLL... we asked for the HRW menu. There was an uncomfortable silence from our servers who slunk away to a neighboring table who'd probably just ordered a bottle of Screaming Eagle Cab. As would become shortly and oh so abundantly clear, those words instantly transported us to ""Dining Siberia""! Upon the mention of the presumably déclassé HRW menu (read: you cheapskates), our cadre of waiters dispersed and all that was left was a hapless fellow who resignedly took our HRW order (and insisted that we order all 3 courses from the get-go. Nice.) When we asked if they had NZ Sauvignon Blancs on their wine list, he pretentiously announced that ""Mr. Vallone is only concentrating on French, Italian and California wines"". Wanting to comply with Mr T's three country wine edict, we ordered a 2008 bottle of Sancerre. At which point we were told, ""Are you sure you want to order that? It is our last bottle"". And your point is?As for the food, we all had the ""Lasagnette"" to start which consisted of dry-ish free form lasagna which had done a significant amount of time under the kitchen heat lamp. Once we were done chewing on dried out pasta sheets, our main course of Veal Scallopine with sauteed tomatoes and a fried artichoke swiftly appeared. It was room temperature - I guess there was no more room left under the heat lamps. Once we polished off the veal, like a cuckoo clocking striking on the hour, our pre-ordered desserts arrived. I had a slice of Praline Cheesecake which was decent but honestly, it was no better than something I could have purchased from Randall's. Our check arrived 5 minutes later and after paying approximately $80/pp for very mediocre, pre-prepared food, we were on our way to the valet stand.As you can probably tell from my review, HRW diners get short shrift at Tony's of which I'm mildly resentful. One deserves better from paying a $80/pp tab. Hence, next time I'm in the mood for Italian, I'll go to Giacomo's or Dolce Vita instead. Basically anywhere but here.

I had the wrong wine poured in my glass and the bar drinks seemed delayed.

The entrees are what has me giving this place such good ratings. If you're thinking about a salad, don't hesitate and go with the Wyatt Salad. I know it's expensive but it's worth the price! There was more fresh seafood on the plate than there were greens. The mangos in the salad were extremely fresh and ripe. The dish was delicious, fresh, big, and full of seafood.

Normally I couldn't care less, but it was changed to a different station which made it super obvious. You know when you were a kid and randomly decided to walk into your mom's bathroom and play with her makeup you'd be super careful to leave it the way it was before so she wouldn't notice and you wouldn't get in trouble? I feel like if you're going to listen to music in my car as a valet, then please just pretend to try to cover it up and change it back to the original station when you bring the car back to me.I probably wouldn't have even mentioned this if I had enjoyed my experience here, but considering the service and food, I will be as picky and judgmental of every fault at this establishment.At the beginning, this place had set itself up for a 4 star review. I had made a reservation and mentioned that we had a symphony concert to attend at 7pm, so we needed to be out by 6:30pm. When we walked in, they seated us quickly and when I gave them my last name they immediately realized I was the one that had a time constraint and had to be out within 1.5 hours (which shouldn't be terribly hard to do, i would think -- and neither did they at the time of booking).This is where the up and down (mostly down) of the dining experience started.We came in with a coupon I got on Google Offers. I guess I didn't read carefully and thought the $40 for $80 tasting menu was for two people, not one. I take full responsibility for that. I will NOT take responsibility for the fact that the rest of the time we felt like we were being a little bit judged / ignored after I pulled out the coupon. Minus 1 stars.The portions were European sized. I actually usually like it when a restaurant gives normal-sized portions like that. But if you're going to bunch three 1-inch diameter, 1/4-inch thick medallions in the middle of a 12-inch diameter plate and charge $18 for it... then at least do a little dance for us or have a live quartet playing in the background. I don't understand how restaurants can get away with that. Minus 1 star.Later through our dinner, our waiter asked my boyfriend and me if it's prom time. And, since I graduated high school 7 years ago, I said I wasn't sure. In part, this is a compliment that we both look so young (boyfriend's been out of school for 9 years). On the other hand, I was slightly offended because of the insinuation that it must be because of our age that we came in with a coupon. Meh. Minus 0.5 stars.I decided to get the flounder. I had never had flounder before but I thought my first experience would probably go best if I got it at a $$$$ place. And I have to say I was not disappointed at all. I now have a top two types of fish: sea bass and flounder. Plus 0.5 stars for giving me that good first flounder experience.The dessert was the one part of dinner that was American sized. For the amounts they charge and the overall snootiness of this place, I would have expected much better dessert. Don't get me wrong, it was good. But I think I prefer La Madeleine's tuxedo cake over Tony's. No points lost, just disappointing.Now it was already 6:23pm by the time they had brought us the dessert. They were cutting it a bit close to getting us out by 6:30pm, but I still had faith in them. But when we finally got someone's attention again, they said our assigned waiter (who we had given our coupon to) had an emergency and had left abruptly so they couldn't ring us up. Well, I'm sorry for your incompetency, but you knew full well we had to be out by 6:30 and now it is 6:42 already. Get with it. (I didn't say this out loud to them; just mumbled it to my boyfriend, instead.) Anyhow, after them alternately coming over to ask us if we'd found the coupon in our emails using our phones and ignoring us to serve the very, very rich people around us, we finally walked out at 6:58pm.

In addition, a mandatory gratuity of 20% was automatically added to our check.The service was horrendous, the food was terrible, and the overall atmosphere was hectic and disorderly. I sent a lengthy email to the general manager, who only responding by asking for my phone number, but I have yet to hear from him.Our experience at Tony's that night was by far THE worst restaurant experience we have ever had. We arrived a few minutes early for our 9:30 PM reservation, but we were seated immediately in the wine cellar. To start off our evening, it was uncomfortably cold in that room. The table we were seated at was hit directly by the air conditioning vents. We asked to be moved to another table, and our ""server"" (I am using that term very loosely since we received absolutely no real service that night), said he would have to check with the host staff. We were eventually able to change tables, but it took quite a while of waiting. When we did change tables, the new table had not been set, and the table cloth had a large hole in it. We moved our own glasses of water with us, but our silverware and plates were not moved for a while. Someone stopped by our table to ask if everything was all right, as he had heard we had a problem. We mentioned that the room was uncomfortably cold, and he offered to bring us a drink for the trouble. My husband accepted his offer, but we ended up being charged for the drink anyway. During our first 45 minutes of being seated, we were only served with water. We asked for a wine list four different times, from two different people. The same thing happened with the cocktail menu. We did receive a small bread basket at about 10:15 PM but no butter. I asked for butter from four different people but finally received it at about 10:45 PM, more than an hour after we had already been seated. We did not even receive menus until about 10:30 PM. We were ""served"" by more than three different people that evening, and by the end of the night, we had no idea who our actual server was supposed to be. All of the service staff we encountered was brash, rude, impatient, unhelpful, unprofessional, and inattentive. We were not offered drink refills throughout our visit, and when it came to ordering our meal, we were offered no assistance or explanations on the menu, even after asking questions. The gentleman who took my order was not even looking at our table, let alone my face, when I was placing my order. He was paying attention to something else that was happening a few tables away and had to ask me to repeat my order twice before he actually wrote it down. Now, onto the food quality, which was another major disappointment of our visit. All of our dishes were served at a poor temperature, with the exception of the salad my husband ordered. For our first course, I ordered the squash ravioli while my husband ordered the tortellini. Both were served lukewarm, making them terribly unappetizing. For the second course, I ordered the lobster bisque, and my husband ordered the salad. The lobster bisque was also served only lukewarm, and it had been sitting in the bowl for such a long time prior to being served that there was a caked layer on top of the soup, making it completely inedible. My husband's salad looked like a mess of ingredients with a completely unpleasant appearance. For our main course, my husband ordered the truffled filet, and I ordered the braised short ribs. My husband had requested his steak to be prepared medium well, but it was more like medium rare. He could not eat the steak because it was so undercooked. The asparagus that was served with the steak had been peeled at the stalk, where it should have been cut off, so it also had an unattractive appearance. The asparagus was simply steamed and had absolutely no flavor. As soon as my dish was placed in front of me, an awful smell rose from the short ribs dish. This was by far the most unappetizing dish of the evening. My husband was not even willing to have a taste of my dish. We also ordered a side of the truffled macaroni and cheese, but the pasta was completely undercooked and still far too chewy to enjoy. The truffles tasted ""off"", and this dish was not good, either. We hardly touched any of our dishes because of the terrible quality and taste, but none of the service staff took notice of this. Not once did anybody ask if we were enjoying our meal.Never again will we return to Tony's restaurant, let alone for a special occasion. We had a much better experience at Capital Grille and Eddie V's, so we'll continue to go there.","alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=140,Kris G.,"Houston, TX",181,32,44,,7/23/14,"CAN SOMEONE ADD A 6TH STAR OPTION?!!!

Despite expecting somewhat delayed service for this special occasion, everything that could have gone wrong did! This dinner was so extremely disappointing...Let me preface this review by saying that my boyfriend was overjoyed when he made the reservation for our evening at Tony's weeks in advance. This restaurant was top rated in Houston, we were told I'd have a vegetarian option, and that the price would be $150.00 per person. He was more than willing to pay this price as he thought we'd be receiving wonderful service, food, atmosphere, etc. to justify that. Firstly we were seated in the back room with small round tables. There were roughly 10 tables in this room with a few servers and 2-3 what-looked-like Managers. I have no idea who actually took ""care"" of us this night because no one actually came to our table and introduced themselves as our server. We sat at our table for almost 10 minutes before we received water. I noticed everyone has bread and butter at their tables and asked the man who brought us water if we'd be receiving that as well to which he replied yes. Walked away and never came back. 15 minutes in we were brought menus by another server. 20 minutes in we were brought bread with no butter by another server. I asked if we could have butter and he said he'd bring it out immediately. He came back into the room with butter in his hand looked around as if he'd forgotten who asked and then proceeded to set it on the counter where they were preparing drinks or wine for people. We both just sat there jaw slacked like ""really""?. Finally after another 10 minutes of waiting another server came by asking if we were ready to order.I asked the server about the vegetarian option as I didn't see it on the menu. He looked puzzled and said ""uh.. Let me get your server and see"". I tried to stop him to mention the butter for our bread that had been sitting on the counter for 10'minutes but he had wandered off. Here we sat again no butter and no idea about the vegetarian option for another few minutes. Finally a manager came by and sat butter on our table. I realized we needed napkins and asked for napkins as well. He nodded and walked off.Assuming that the server had relayed the information we sat there waiting again for our actual server (whoever that was) to bring us the info for the vegetarian menu. Another server came by and asked us again if we were ready to order. I said again no, we were told I'd have a vegetarian option. I also asked for napkins and hadnt received them. This server actually went to the chef and brought back the menu option for me and brought us our napkins. Finally! I was excited to see what I'd be having this evening and this server actually seemed to be helpful! I ordered a mushroom pasta for course 1, a mushroom risotto for course 2, and a vegetable plate for course 3. My boyfriend also ordered his food at this time.It's sad to say that when our food was brought out EACH COURSE was wrong or for another table. First course they set down some tartar looking thing- nope this wasn't mine. ""Oh I'm sorry."" They grab the right dish. Second course they set down an octopus. Nope not mine. They replace it. Third course they set down some grilled steak thing. Nope not mine.Finally after receiving the right dishes I was disappointed by the quality of food. The mushroom pasta was insanely salty. The mushroom risotto was good but somewhat bland. The grilled vegetable plate had zucchini, squash, pepper, and some asparagus. Pretty darn good! My boyfriend did not enjoy his gumbo or his main dish (I think it was steak?) as he said both were bland. Finally the deserts came out and were pretty good. I was disappointed by the service and only enjoyed 1 of three courses... Keep in mind I had NO IDEA how much we was paying for this meal. I see the check go down on our table- 300$ for food, $25 for tax, and they ADDED A GRATUITY FOR $65.00!!!!!! What the heck??!?! Who was even getting that gratuity?!?! I had no idea we would spend $400.00 on this! I wouldn't have even spent 120.00$! How on earth is risotto, a tiny portion of pasta and a few slices of grilled vegetables worth $150.00 for me?!I felt like we were completely taken advantage of.Never ever ever again!!!!","alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=140,Doug M.,"League City, TX",281,384,397,Elite ’17,12/19/12,"Tony's is a Houston tradition.

(That last statement is meant to be as side-notey as Gretchenly possible, especially in light of drama on an oldish talk thread.) It's conveniently located within easy driving distance of both River Oaks and general Houston blue blood. Not necessarily the staunch old rickety, get-dressed-in-formal-attire-to-eat-dinner types, nor the scrimp-every-last-dime-who-drive-their-twenty-year-old-cars-and-darn-their-own-socks types. I'm talking about the special occasioners and patron's of the arts types.Tony's opened in this location a few years ago. I never went to Maxim's, so have no point of reference, but I like the interior decor of Tony's. It tries its hardest to camouflage the fact that an office building is sitting on top of it. While inside, I didn't notice it. Dropping my car off at, and picking it up from, valet, I thought ""Hotel drive?!"" I think this was the polished drive and the automatic sliding doors. The camouflage is mainly a bubble wall, a few large urns full of flowers and surrounded by wine, and a gigantic window into the kitchen. From my vantage point, I could only see gigantic pots and pans hanging from the ceiling, so I only looked over occasionally. My main focus, when I wasn't distracted by the wonderful conversation at the table, was a Rauschenberg that was hung very prominently over the bar. I was very cleverly sat facing it. (not going to critique it, not going to critique it, not going to critique it...okay fine, but it should have been hung a lot lower than it was. It's mirrored...as in reflective. I don't feel I experienced it properly, as I feel people's reflection should be part of the piece.) There are other pieces around the restaurant, including a sculpture and more paintings.I ordered the three course meal. Tomato soup (very good), Involtini of Chicken, and Sugar Free Ricotta Custard. Eh. It tasted mass prepared. Good, but not stunning. My first choice and intention was to order an entree. There are several that sounded wonderful, but I followed the herd and ordered the coursed meal. Honestly, the thing that really won me over into conceding was the mention of a Sugar Free dessert...and a custard at that. It was good. A little better than good, possibly great...no it was just slightly better than good.

The water-filled glass ringing the entrance side is beautiful, the massive sculpture in the middle looking like a three-pronged modern statue of Venus is fun to puzzle over for a bit, and as ridiculous as it may sound, the ceiling and red trim are are clean, modern, and very impressive. The decor is spot on. Sadly, even the best eye candy in town can't save the restaurant from its tangible failings: bad service and blah food.My first tinge of doubt hit when I met the Maitre'D. She was nice enough, but seeing her nervously scurrying around like a headless chicken while we waited for a table wasn't a good impression. I got the feeling she was the proprietor's daughter making inroads into the business rather than the calm, seasoned professional one would expect in a place like this.After being seated, it took over 15 minutes just to get menus. The dining room was full but nothing crazy. The same waiter provided a larger table seated after us with food and drinks faster than he did us. Hmm. Out of the 7 courses served, only two were done well: the bolognese and the sea bass. The bolognese was appropriately meaty and flavorful and the sea bass was cooked to perfection with creative saucing. Everything else was drab to bad, including: (1) undercooked risotto; (2) squash blossom with breading that tasted identical to beer battered onion rings served in bowling alleys all across the midwest (though served alongside a nice salad); (3)over cooked, bland duckling puzzlingly served with a butter knife for deboning; and (4) the scrambled egg whites they sold as souffle. The bottom line: bad service and inadequate food seductively gussied up by mind-blowing ambiance. Every high-end game in town I've tried hasn't just been better, they've been far better. Learn from my mistakes, and just spend the same money at Da Marco for Italian food that is considerably better cooked, much more creative, and worth every dime.

From celebrities to dignitaries... no other restaurant has the clout or star power like Tony's. And in its latest location... it's better than ever!For us common folk, Tony's is a special occasion (anniversary, job promotion, milestone birthdays, etc). For ""old money"" patrons, its a Tuesday dinner. Tony's gotten younger now, a bit current with the times. A modern ambiance, more relaxed stance on the ""no jacket & tie"" policy, and a young head chef to steer Mr. Vallone's vision.What is about this place that makes its soooo special? What's the hype all about? You may ask...Is the food the best in Houston? NoIs the service the best in Houston? NoOr how about the dining area? NoSo what is it then? It's none of that, and all of the above. In short, it's MAGICAL!My review may be a bit skewed because Tony's played host to a night of fond memories for my girlfriend and me. After being turned down by this girl for months, she finally decided to go out on a ""real"" date w/ me. So I had to impress... only one place conjures up to mind, and that's Tony's. When Houstonians hear ""lets have Tony's for dinner""... in an instant, your attitude change. You get giddier, your tone of voice gets higher and pitchier, and everything else is quickly forgotten. DINING AREA:Its been over a decade since I've ate at Tony's. Reservations were for 5:45. As we arrived, we informed the staff that we had a musical to catch at 7:00. So everything needed to be executed with urgency. We were seated in the middle of the dining room. If it was in the old restaurant, we probably would've been seated near the kitchen doors. So I'm happy about the new layout here. It is great for people watching. But none of that would matter tonight, my eyes were totally fixated on her. I did, however, get to scan the entire decor. More contemporary then its former location. Sky-lighted ceiling, arched dining room, glass kitchen, and a huge prevalent sculpture is distinctly remembered.SERVICE:A team of waiters came out to place napkins on our lap, hand us an assortment of bread, and fill our glasses with water. The Headwaiter or maybe captain, dressed in a suit, asked when we needed to get out. So I told him of the situation and from that moment on, service was impeccable. Execution was tactful w/o ever making us feel hurried or rushed. Water was always full, plates were immediately cleared when finished, and new dishes brought out soon after. Their team of waiters were always observant w/o ever being intrusive. White glove service, they were a well oiled machine.APPS:We had Napolean Duo and Crab tower for appetizers. The Napolean duo was basically thinly sliced salmon and ahi tuna carpaccio w/ tuscan melon and asian pear. It was ok, like eating fresh sashimi minus the wasabi and soy sauce. The Crab tower was juicy lump crab meat over diced tomatoes, avocado and arugula. The crab was succulent and sweet.ENTREES:I picked the Veal Medallions and she had the Lemon Snapper. In addition, we ordered Truffled Mac n' cheese and White Asparagus as sides. My two medallions were tender and nicely seared. Didn't care too much for my sauce. It just didn't work with the dish. The salmon was a bit overcooked. Other then that it was ok. Our sides... can't remember. Must be average then if I can't remember.DESSERT:When you come here, and can only order one thing... what do you order? The Grand Marnier Souffle of course! They will only serve it for a minimum of two people. Sitting in a large ramequin, this french classic is huge!!! Creamy inside, with a generous amount of Grand Marnier... it's ethereally light. Accompanied with a tree-like display of strawberries and blackberries. The sweet and tart flavors of the berries, counter-balances the delicate flavors of the souffle. SIMPLY REMARKABLE!After everything was said and done, Tony's laid the groundwork to a wondrous evening. Something celestial occurs in this place... for the first time, my gf admitted she saw me ""differently"". Don't know if it was my company or the alcohol... but whatever it was, we've been happily in love ever since! It was worth every cent, PRICELESS!

Rich, earthy, musky, rare and delicious. We were having a craving for truffles, so we went to the place we knew would be offering them: Tony's.Tony's is the iconic Houston fine dining restaurant. It has been the preferred destination for the city's glitterati for many years, but some foodies grumbled that the cuisine was too staid, too traditional, too boring.In our experience, nothing could be farther from the truth. My guess is that these foodies have never dined at Tony's, and that is their loss.Tony Vallone is a master restaurateur, and he periodically reinvents the restaurant, making it fresh and new, but never gets caught up in the fly-by-night trends that tempt the less savvy host. And the Vallone touch is evident on every plate that exits the kitchen... this attention to detail is a key that separates Tony's from Houston's other fine dining establishments. The latest incarnation of Tony's resides at the beautiful Richmond and Timmons location that Tony's occupied after decades on Post Oak. Built from the ground up to Tony Vallone's exacting specifications, this dramatic setting was the backdrop for our truffle degustation.Executive Chef Francesco Casetta's kitchen is firing on all cylinders, and created a variety of dishes that flowed together like movements in a symphony. Several featured the ethereal truffle as an ingredient.We started with a simple Tortelloni Bolognese - housemade pasta stuffed with three cheeses and draped in Tony's superb bolognese meat sauce. The flavors are bold yet smooth, and this dish warmed up our senses for the upcoming courses.Next was my favorite appetizer - Paglia e Fieno. A deceptively simple dish featuring fresh ribbons of green and white tagliatelle, drizzled with a light cream sauce and accented with thin slices of fresh black truffles. Simple and superlative.We then tried something more exotic - Tagliarini with Sicilian Sea Urchin. Smooth strands of tagliarini were tossed in a light creamy sauce of pinot grigio and alba mushrooms, and mixed with chunks of sea urchin. The dish was surprisingly spicy; the heat was balanced by the creamy pasta. It was something we'd never experienced before, but would gladly order again.Our final appetizer is one we can rarely pass up at Tony's - the Japanese-influenced Ribbons and Squares. Fresh, sushi-grade blue fin tuna prepared two ways: perfect thumb-sized cubes, and thin, pasta-like ribbons formed into a cylindrical shape. The tuna is accented with fresh avocado puree and a tangy soy-lime vinaigrette. We love sushi, and the balance of this dish speaks to a bright future if the Vallones ever decide to open a sushi bar.After these delicious entrees, it was time for the main course. More truffles were called for, so we ordered the rich Stuffed Truffled Filet of Beef. This may be the best steak in the city - a large, thick filet of USDA Prime beef, naturally aged for 40 days, and stuffed with black truffle butter. The truffle flavor infuses the beef, and the combination is greater than the sum of the parts.On the side we asked for the oven-roasted truffled potatoes and the decadent truffled macaroni & cheese. These side dishes accented the steak very nicely, and we were awash in the aroma and flavor of truffles.We barely had room for dessert, but missing the souffle at Tony's seems like a crime. This time we selected the rich bananas foster souffle, which was a delightful finish to an unforgettable meal.Sadly, my waistline won't tolerate a meal like this every day, but I'll be looking forward to the next gastronomical adventure at Tony's. The restaurant never disappoints.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=160,Alan J.,"Austin, TX",0,121,12,,1/13/15,"Ridiculously overpriced.

Tony's' approach to Restaurant Week is the opposite of what I have experienced at other Houston restaurants. Every other place I have dined has been excellent in quality and service - in hopes that you will come back later and pay full price. Tony's seems to have the attitude that Restaurant Weekers don't have the $ to come back without the discount. Bad assumption. I have been to Tony's several times (not during Restaurant Week) and really enjoyed it, especially the soufflé. However, my Restaurant Week experience changed my mind and ensured that I will not be back. We had to flag down a waiter to give us menus (it seemed they forgot about us). We had to ask again for Restaurant Week menus even though we noted this with our reservation. The food was mediocre at best, and undercooked at worst. Three people at the table had the veal; the flavor was overpowered by the capers.

Like another reviewer said, just because I'm dining off the Restaurant Week menu doesn't mean you should give me mediocre service. Every time I have dined at a 4 or 5 star hotel, I notice that the service is always a cut above a typical casual restaurant. The waitstaff go above and beyond and add in those special touches to show their exceptional service and training. Not the case here. I felt like the waiter just brought my my food and picked up my plates. That's it. There was no custom or personal service. I really expected a lot more from Tony's. As for the food, it was just okay. Portions are a generous size for a fine dining establishment. I probably wouldn't recommend getting anything I got (if you're curious, I had the mussels, red snapper, and cheesecake. Well, the cheesecake was good).

I reserved a table here a month in advance for our 1st Anniversary, I requested for a quiet table and informed them of our ""Special Occassion"".We arrived just on time at 7.30pm. Pulling into their main entrance to valet we already felt a little intimidated with all the expensive cars parked around the vicinity... As we walked in, we were the only 2 that were wearing ""business casual"", at least 90% of the patrons have suits or some kind. I'm aware of the dresscode here but just testing the water and was surprised that they let us in... hehehehe, maybe coz they know we are celebrating...Anyway, we were seated in the middle of the restaurant, not so quiet after all with all the action going around us and servers walking behind me. Nonetheless, we felt quite welcomed! Here's the order of our evening:-- Cocktail --Ginger Blossom $12.50: Way too much Vodka Citron and not much of the ginger & citrus mixtures! I didnt finish it...Prosecco Royal $9: with Hibiscus Flower. Very refreshing and a great aperitif. Highly recommended!-- Appetizer --Hudson Valley Foie Gras $22: Recommended by the head-waiter. Chilled, its rich and soft but just cant beat the seared version where the taste and flavor comes out.Soft Shell Crab $15: Also a Recommended dish, claimed to be flown in fresh today. Its deep fried with thick breadcrumb coating... really, didnt do the crab justice. The coating tasted so greasy and heavy that I could not even taste the crab. Huge dissapointment!-- Entree --Veal Medallions $29: Two reasonable size, thick center cut beautifully seared medium rare medallions, still juicy and tender. Unfortunately, the accompaniment sauce was way too sour and just didnt work with the meat. What a let down...Roasted Duckling $32: THE BEST DUCK dish EVER! That says it all... This is a 2-serving order but they accommodated us due to the ""special occasion"". Just amazingly roasted crispy skin, tender not chewy nor tough, still slightly gamey but not overpowering yet very flavorful. Tony's really nailed this duck perfectly... A MUST HAVE!-- Dessert --Souffle $12/person: We saw too many tables ordering the souffle, so we were duped! We had the chocolate flavor with Grand Marnier. Honestly, I'm not a big fan of souffle, so, it was A-okay! We both didnt finish our dessert, instead we had quite a few of the steroid-induced (or apple-size according to my partner) strawberry... Surprisingly, they were quite sweet too. Each table gets a ""tree"" of strawberry with meringue and blob of cotton candy, I dont know why???So, whats our conclusion? Well, we came, we seen, we ate, we are DONE! Thanks Tony's for letting us in and served us like any other suits wearing millionaires. We are just a middle working class adventurous couple that couldnt and wouldnt fit into the stuffy over pretentious kinda place... However, if you want to see and be seen among the River Oaks folks and maybe some Houston's Forbes Millionaires, then this is the place to be!

We had sauteed spinach and mac and cheese as our side dishes. All was very delicious. You HAVE to get the mac and cheese. I could have just eaten that and the appetizer and been tickled pink!

There were a ton of men filling water, offering bread, taking plates. They were very attentive.

We were seated promptly and given the option of a banquette or a table, the banquette was just straight across, so you were sitting right next to each other, quite an odd set up and definitely not for me. Love that they give you time to settle in before handing you a menu and that the specials are printed out daily on their own separate menu. The wines by the glass selection was wonderful, they even had a great Brunello as an option.I opted to start with the lobster bisque and try the flounder special. Hubby had the short ribs ravioli and the Osso Bucco. The bisque was overwhelmingly rich and I shouldn't have eaten the whole bowl, but I did, making me too full to finish my flounder. They gave us the option of preordering a souffle for dessert, which we did because we had seen them go by earlier and they looked amazing. I think everyone in the place had the souffle. The Osso Bucco was perfectly done and the presentation of the huge steak knife was wasted, it didn't need one at all. I was too full of the bisque to try the truffle mac n' cheese, but I have some to try in my take out container.The ginormous souffle arrived with fresh berries on this metal tree sculpture, with sugar, whipped cream and chocolate sauce. They plated us each a piece of the souffle and took the other half away. I wonder what happens to all the half eaten souffles? Does the staff get to enjoy them? They cannot possibly be thrown out, can they? There was a whole lot of wasted souffle going around.I nearly forgot my to go of my flounder because they leave it at the front desk for you, right as we got into the car my husband remembered and retrieved it for me.

I rarely go to a restaurant that I feel hits the mark on everything, but they truly did. Service was phenomenal. The duck breast was cooked perfectly, the skin was crispy and the meat was moist. Off the menu, we ordered the lobster as well as lamb filet mignon. The lobster was good, but not the best I've ever had. However, I had never heard of lamb filet mignon before in my life, and it was AMAZING. One of the best cuts of meat I've ever had.We also sprung for the individual souffle with peach topping, and I am NOT a big dessert fan, but I made sure to lick that plate clean.

The duck dumplings tasted like it was out of a 'Hungry Man' TV dinner platter, over-sauced and grimy texture. The scallops were tender and flavorful with a nice caramelized coat. The ~$50 steak was not cooked to order. Here's my logic: If you pay more, you should get more. So, if an average restaurant charges above average prices, it warrants a below average ranking. Conclusion: Come here only if you want to impress your high school prom date or your bourgeois wife. Just because a restaurant decides to dim its' lights and is liberal with butter, it doesn't make it 'nice' or 'fancy'. See below for supplemental info: - Price: Not worth it (~$15 and ~$40 per starter and entree, respectively) - Atmosphere: Not my cup of tea, 2/5 (Old Houston blood peppered with 'special occasion' diners) - Service: Great, 5/5 - Sanitation: Great , 5/5 Big turnoff: - Cheesy atmosphere.

It's an ""Old School"" place that has been wonderfully current with the food trends, while creating amazing dishes and dining experiences. Blame it on the truffles....My first time here was a couple of years ago, because a friend of mine wanted to try their white truffles, so four of us came here for dinner with ""truffles"" on the brain. We shared the risotto with white truffle and angel hair pasta with white truffles as our appetizer, split 4 ways. Okay, I'll be honest. I don't really know if the White Truffles blew me away as much as everything else did, but certainly were tasty. I actually love truffle oil anyways, so this was fine. Not sure if they were $230 a serving fine, but ok whatever.What I REALLY enjoyed was the truffle presentation: a man in the tuxedo and white gloves carried out this silver tray with a ""treasure chest"" that actually carried the white truffles in them.. The Truffle Show was a total side bonus and entertained the heck out of me... especially after a glass of bubbly. They watched us as we took our first bites, and I seriously believe that NOBODY would dare gripe in that situation because honestly, it was intense! thankfully things got only better after the truffle course... The salads were all very good, for salad. Best of all were my entree and dessert:Lamb Shank braised in Port, and then the Grand Marniere Souffle. Talk about sad when I found they don't have the lamb shank on the menu! that was one of the best lamb shanks I had ever tasted. The last dinner I had there I went for the roast duckling... amazing. Duck prepared perfectly is a thing of beauty. Enough said. Today at lunch was another delicious and delightful experience. I opted for something ""lighter"" and their Steak Salad. I was creally craving some meat, and this was the perfect fix: perfectly grilled and tender steak, bibb lettuce, which I love, and gorgonzola... The only complaint is that I couldn't have souffle because there was just not time.

You've got to like a place that has been around in various forms for--what is it now, 40 years?--in a city where fine dining establishments are luck to make it to the age of 3 or 4. You've also got to like a place that is obsessed with truffles. And finally, the interior decor is incredible; I could count on one hand the number of restaurants that were similarly impressive in that regard. But of course, that pedigree comes with a hefty price tag, and is Tony's ""one of the best [Italian restaurants] in the country,"" as some Yelpers have claimed? I would say no. It's not that there's anything to complain about--I've never had a bad meal there, and the service has always been exceptional. At the same time, however, the experience has never been so transcendent that I would say it's one of the best restaurants in the nation, or even in Texas.

I will say the service is the best I've had in Houston (which isn't saying much since I've found the service at most upscale Houston eateries to be sub par). It's also a place you can go and feel comfortable wearing a jacket, so if you want to dress up it's a good choice. My last visit I had the Ribbons and Squares appetizer and my date had the Agnolotti. Both were OK, but the portions were tiny. I had the stuffed truffle filet and can't remember what date had (guess it wasn't memorable!). Again, good, but nothing that rang our bell.

This is my absolute FAVORITE restaurant. If only I could eat there every day...Tony's is a fabulous restaurant in the heart of Greenway Plaza and the place to be. My husband and I have been twice (both before we were married...hmmm...there better not be a pattern) and both times we were seated at our table as soon as we walked in the door. There was no seating chart, and no wait list. Our table was pre-determined before we walked in the door. Upon being seated the first time, we were dining with the likes of Jeff Bagwell and Milo Hamilton (we watched as Milo went over to say hello since he was dining separately with his guests). Everything was fascinating from the people watching to the fashion watching to the food watching (seeing what people ordered). The salt-crusted snapper is a favorite of large groups. The first time we were seated in a romantic booth for two that overlooked the tables of the main room and the second time we were seated at a table that was front and center where we could see every single person walk in the door. Memorable food...the first time we had an appetizer of gnocchi. The most melt in your mouth dish I have EVER tasted! My husband had the lobster bisque both times and I tried it the second time. It was so delicious that I ate the entire bowl, which is a big no-no since it fills you up instantly. Not to mention, they constantly serve delicious breads and whatever bites the kitchen sends your way. I had trouble enjoying my fish and, yes, my souffle afterwards. The first time we both had the sea bass as our entree and it was perfection! The second time I believe he had a steak and I had fish, but all I could remember was how full I felt from the bisque. We did have the chocolate souffle both times as well and it was also perfection. I don't think there is any other word to describe it! The service is excellent! They leave you alone at the appropriate times and they tend to your every need. The service is nothing less than amazing. The restaurant as a whole is classy and a true fine dining experience. If you choose to take any leftovers home, they clear the table and package your food in the back and send it around (as in not through the dining room) to the front. You can pick it up in the front while you wait for the valet to bring your car around (if it isn't one of the ultra luxury cars parked out front). Like the other posters, I agree...completely first class, fine dining from start to finish!","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=220,Patricia H.,"Houston, TX",0,12,,,8/22/13,"My husband and I had dinner here on Tuesday night. The restaurant decor is gorgeous! For starters, he ordered the lobster squash blossom, and I ordered a spinach salad, or at least I expected a salad. His starter was magnificent. Mine was very good, too, even though it was very different from what I expected from the description on the menu. My ""salad"" was chopped with spinach, blue cheese, garlic, and avocado, and it was molded nice presentation, unique, and tasty. He ordered the tuna. It was OK, but not nearly as good as his starter or my entree. I ordered the sea bass. It was really delicious, and for me, about a week's worth of food--not so with the tuna. For dessert, he ordered a raspberry gelatto (sp?). It was so-so, very fancy presentation, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it. It seemed to be all about the presentation without much thought to the actual taste. I ordered the peach bread pudding. The waiter assembled it at our table. Call me a rube, but I wasn't sure if I was supposed to ""see"" this or not as he was hidden behind my chair and only my husband and the other patrons were able to watch. Anyway, it tasted terrible. I love bread pudding, but this was the worst I've ever had. It was so bad that I couldn't eat it, but not one of the numerous hovering wait staff bothered to inquire as to why I didn't eat it. I didn't send it back because I was freezing to death and ready to get out of there. I am giving the restaurant three stars for some of the food that was amazing and the decor. About the staff: The maitre'd who asked me ""Will madame look at a menu?"" was too stuffy for my taste. This level of formality was void of any comfort or welcome to first-time diners. It set the tone for restaurant. It may not have been intentional, but I felt as though he was looking down his nose at us. Also, my husband was informed of the dress code when he made our reservation. However, we noticed two men at a nearby table who were not wearing coats. We weren't sure why they have a dress code when only some patrons are asked to abide by it. I had on a dress with a sweater, but as I said before, I was miserably cold. Although we enjoyed some of the food and the decor, we won't go back.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=220,Jonathan F.,"Austin, TX",12,18,1,,7/20/09,"Three times the charm, so time to write up the review I've been waiting to do.So far, having been to a least a dozen of the higher end restaurants in Houston (Da Marco's, Quattro, Cafe Annies, etc.) I can safely say that Tony's so far is the best. For me, the point of going to a restaurant is to eat something that you are unable to create at home, to experience something that would take you too much time and effort to even attempt. I'm not going to brag about my cooking, but I'm no boxed mac cheeser either. I know what a roasted butternut squash and ricotta tortellini should taste like, what seasonal cooking means, what to look for at the farmer's market, why texture us just as important as taste. And so, all these things are fully satisfied with Tony's. There is something incredibly gratifying about eyeing a beautiful dish, hoping in your mind that you experience some obscene, sensual taste, and it delivers. It's the exact opposite of craving that spaghetti and meatballs and finding that the meat was once frozen, most likely in Delaware. The first time I went to Tony's I had lunch, a Vitello Tonnato that was fantastic. The veal comes shaved paperthin over a bed of fresh celery, and the Tonnato sauce that covers it is smooth and exceptional. The primi I had with it was the Ribbons and Squares, an Asian infused art work of raw tuna. The second time, I tried the Lasgnette, with the Kobe burger. I remember having a chocolate dessert, but do not remember exactly what. Perhaps not a good sign, but I still wanted to go back. It was still a great little meal. Well, tonight I've had my best meal so far this year. I was feeling ravenous, so I ordered the special appetizer as well as one off the menu. The menu item was the Ricotta and Spinach stuffed ravioli, and it is better than I make (I do make my own fresh pasta dough). The second appetizer was a Osso Bucco Ravioli with two pillowy gnocchi smothered with a cherry tomato red sauce. The gnocchi was the best I've ever had, and the Osso Bucco stuffed ravioli were absolutely perfect.Tried the roasted hen for main course, had the side of Truffled Mac n Cheese with it, both were solid. The Cornish hen was roasted perfectly, crispy skin, tender and moist meat, and a tangy orange reduction sauce poured over it accentuated the meat without hiding it. The Mac and Cheese was unique, and most likely I will order it again.Then of course, the souffle. Chocolate with Grand Marnier Whipped Cream and a chocolate sauce. I went heavy on the cream, light on the sauce. Best souffle I've ever had. A word about service: it's good, a decent compliment to the ambience of a beautifully designed interior. But when you're at a culinary level that Tony's pursues, I'm not interested terribly in how good the service is. It's going to be manageable no matter what. It's the food I'm after, and Tony's brings everything together flawlessly. Having been on a round of antibiotics, I've not had the wine. The extensive list is well talked about, so I'm sure there are gems and jewels to be had. Alas, I cannot comment on them. If you live in Houston, no matter what economic class you occupy, visit Tony's at least once. Viewing the menu beforehand might help if the price is keeping you away. But if you go, you will not regret it.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,tonys-houston-2,tonys-houston-2https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-houston-2?start=220,Kalebyra W.,"Houston, TX",13,28,2,,11/9/09,Tony's was so good!

First off, the service was excellent, from the servers who brought around the bread to the sommelier who must have brought us 3 half glasses of wine to taste at no charge. As for the food, one of the 2-3 best meals we have had in our lives. We started off with two small pastas--the pansoti with lobster and the goat cheese tortellini. While the tortellini was very tasty, the pansoti with lobster was out-of-this-world-delicious. After the pasta we switched it up and shared a Greenberg Salad which was a very unique ""salad"" because it had no lettuce (a mixture of finely chopped artichokes, onions, tomatoes, hearts of palm, blue cheese) We were not blown away with this like we were with the first course, but it was a very nice dish to have before the entree. My wife had the stuffed truffle fillet of beef which, if you have read some of the other reviews, you know is a top notch piece of meat. While I agree that hers was outstanding, I have to say that the veal medallions I ordered were even better. The medallions were served in some sort of green sauce that was extremely flavorful but not too heavy. There were also five escargot served with the veal. We shared a side of truffled macaroni and cheese which was so good that my wife would only eat 2 noodles at a time to make it last. In addition to the aforementioned 1/2 glasses of wine served to us at no charge, we each had a glass of wine and I had 2 scotches.

I normally do not like capers, but here they worked so well I didn't mind. I had been planning to order the Akaushi filet, but they sold out (the only disappointment of the night). So, our waiter also brought us the Kona Kampachi, on the house. It was some of the best yellowfin tuna I've ever tasted, with a sprinkling of caviar and oil. Next, I ordered the Boston Salad and my boyfriend had the Barrata (prosciutto & honey). The salad wasn't too unique, but still very tasty. The honey and prosciutto in the Barrata were extremely good... but the cheese (some variation of a mozzarella) was a little plain. For our main course, I had the Akaushi sirloin, which was as delicious as you might expect a $100 steak to be, and my boyfriend ordered the veal chop off the night's dinner specials menu. The veal was tender and the Cabernet reduction and morels complemented the meat perfectly. We shared a side of macaroni & cheese with truffles... also delicious if you like the flavor of truffles. We had ordered the chocolate souffle for dessert, and they also brought me pavlova with fresh berries because it was my birthday. The souffle was incredible and impressive, but, despite being a huge chocolate fan, I think I actually enjoyed the pavlova more!For the quality and quantity of the food and the top-notch service, the price really wasn't too bad.

When I got it was served in this Iarge bowl with about as much food as I would serve my dog (if I had a dog). The rice was under cooked and there was little crab inside of the dish. I asked the server to send it back and try to cook it some more but when it returned it tasted only minimally better.

First we started with a variety bread basket that was paired with olive oil and fresh butter. All was fresh and tasty. We had lobster bisque and lasagnette for appetizer. The bisque was a fresh, but mild flavored, lobster soup. There were bits of lobster floating and it had a nice medium consistency. The lasagnette was incredible. Full of cheeses, basil, tomato in between layers of thin, fresh pasta. Simple - the flavors burst in my mouth. The entrees were truffled medallions of beef and seared branzino in saor. I had the fish which was very fresh, cooked perfectly with a nice blood orange sauce. Not the most flavorful though. It was paired with black rice which was delicious. The reviews of the beef were mixed. My friend who has a simpler palate thought it was delicious and full of flavor. ( it was paired with potato wedges which everyone agreed were flavorless, green beans - again flavorless, mushrooms - delicious ) My other friends who have more sophisticated palates thought the sauce was just plain bland. They all agreed, however, that the beef itself was good - it was prepared rare. For desert we had dark chocolate mousse and Elizabeth's praline cheesecake. I tried both and I LOVED both. I am a big fan of cheese cake and make it at home from scratch. The cheesecake was divine. It was heavy with caramelized pralines in the crust and atop.
