You'll want to take a stroll in the garden after dinner while the sun is out! Go ahead and make those reservations though. The dining room isn't very large, and it fills quickly. Prime seating is of course, along the windows, where the backdrop of a perfectly kept, charming garden pond commands your attention. It's quite a beauty given the restaurant's location beside the freeway.The crab cake is tasty and one of their specialties and was indeed delicious though saucier than I'd like. The chicken fried beef tenderloin was average. The batter's consistency and flavor were not as they could be. Not sure tenderloin worked well with this preparation. It also got soggy over the bed of moist potatoes. The portion was surprisingly huge! My dining partner enjoyed his steak.It's worth signing up for their rewards program if you frequent this restaurant.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,brenners-steakhouse-houston,brenners-steakhouse-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brenners-steakhouse-houston?start=0,Shavonda S.,"Houston, TX",89,165,131,Elite ’17,11/20/17,"Went here for hub's company dinner Saturday night and the indoor/outdoor setup, food, open bar, & service were all great.

The meal started off great and the place is beautiful, but suddenly it all went down hill. I ordered my ribeye medium rare. It came back almost medium well. The waitress didn't even ask to cut into it to check to see if it was prepared to the right temperature,which is odd for a nice steak place. It gets worse...She tries to convince me my steak is medium rare and that it the lighting. I've eaten at a lot of steak places that are much darker and I know what a medium rare steak looks like. She takes it back and then brings a small flash light then tries to show me again and basically proves nothing. She says they will make me a new steak.It gets worse...They bring me this thick steak that looks like no ribeye I have seen before. Looks like a New York strip at this point and my birthday happiness has faded. It is rare. It is actually ""Blue"", which is a cold center and a few seconds on the grill. I look at it and said, this is not medium rare. The waitress basically blames me and said they wanted to error on the side of caution. At this point, I'm thinking this steak house does not know how to cook a steak- SAD! I basically gave up and said I would eat it.Manager comes over and looks at it and says he will have them cook it a little more. My husband has finish his meal. The filet he had was good. I should have ordered the filet!The waitress was passive aggressive, which made it so uncomfortable. If you are at a nice steak place and your steak does not come out right, the wait staff should take it back and make it perfect. That is where this could have been fixed.She gave me a free cake on my birthday as an apology for my experience. Figure that, a free cake on my birthday... which restaurant doesn't do that anyway.Manager was so nice.

A common theme among my recent reviews after returning to Houston has been the joy of experiencing certain places that harbor fond memories and finding that those places still ""got it"". Brenner's is certainly one of those.Last night I enjoyed a business dinner with 14 colleagues from various parts of the country, many of whom had never visited Brenner's. We were seated in their private Burgundy room. The service was stellar and the fare, starting with the delicious appetizers through the main course and on to dessert, was outstanding. I enjoyed the opportunity to sample several of Brenner's appetizers - the blackened scallops were delicious, the quail were superb, but I think my favorite was the crab cake - very meaty and flavorful.I would say that about half our group ordered steaks of various cuts, and each person reported theirs to be perfectly cooked to temperature and nicely seasoned. My NY Strip was no exception. I appreciate the fact that Brenner's seasoning compliments the meat without overpowering it. Several ordered seafood entrees, and the compliments on the sea bass were particularly plentiful. One of these days I'll break with tradition and give it a try.We were served a variety of desserts after the meal, but I must confess, I finished off most of my steak leaving no room for sweets.Whether you're seeking a quiet evening out with someone special or a quality experience for a group of business colleagues, you can't go wrong choosing Brenner's. I look forward to returning again and again.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,brenners-steakhouse-houston,brenners-steakhouse-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brenners-steakhouse-houston?start=0,Rebecca K.,"Lafayette Hill, PA",50,111,26,Elite ’17,5/29/17,"We sat in gazebo and it was a nice night in houston.

Our server was very kind and attentive, one of the best servers I've had. 3 of us ordered off the HRW menu and my father ordered off the regular dinner menu. As for the HRW menu, we started with 2 calamaris and 1 lobster bisque. Entree wise, we ordered 2 filet mignons and 1 country fried beef tenderloin (basically their version of chicken fried steak) and we ended with a key lime pie, ice cream cookie sandwich, and apple strudel or something. We also ordered the catch of the day (can't remember the fish) but it was pan seared made with lemon butter along with scallops and arugula. We also ordered a side of mac & cheese and another appetizer, the pork belly. The calamari was tasty and not overly fried. The lobster bisque was good but too salty that day and the pork belly was absolutely delicious (and I loved that sauce/mango pico like thing that went with it). As for the entrees, their version of the chicken fried steak was THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. The breading was not too much and it was lightly fried. The meat was very tender and juicy and the flavor was perfect. The filet mignons were very good as well, but I should have just got it without the peppercorn sauce and used mainly the truffle butter because it was soo good with it. I also put some truffle butter with the mac & cheese even though it didn't need it. Just thinking about it makes me crave the mac & cheese all over again. It was so hot and cheesy but not overly moist. My dad said his entree was pretty good but I'm not huge on fish so I didn't try much. It was tasty nonetheless and didn't taste fishy to me! And of course, the mashed potatoes were bomb.The desserts in my opinion were lacking in comparison to the appetizers and entrees. It didn't taste bad but it was definitely nothing to rave about. If they have better options for that for HRW, this would definitely be a 5. Regardless, looking forward to coming back one day to try other entrees and appetizers.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,brenners-steakhouse-houston,brenners-steakhouse-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brenners-steakhouse-houston?start=0,Bridget B.,"Palm Harbor, FL",71,151,57,Elite ’17,9/13/16,"3.5-4 stars Great service Old school steakhouse ambience.

Little did I know that this Brenner's Steakhouse was the first Brenner's before Brenner's on the Bayou in 1936. Parking is only complimentary valet here. The bar is immediately visible when you walk in through the doors. The bar is located in a great area, especially for those who have to wait awhile before their table is ready. Aside from the visible main dining room, Brenner's has a large room in the back as well. You have to walk through the gorgeous courtyard/garden outside in order to reach the back room though. With a reservation request next to the window in the main room, we were promptly seated and greeted. I highly recommend a window seat - great view of the restaurant and outdoors. Food:Texas Quail (3/5, Bleu cheese, bacon & juniper honey glaze): This was decent, didn't really blow me away. Bacon-wrapped quail tasted better with the juniper honey glaze that was spread out on the plate than eating quail alone. The two pieces of quail were juicy and hot though. This comes with Brennan's version of onion strings. Jumbo Lump Crab Cake (5/5, Gulf crab with tomato basil & lemon butter sauce): ORDER THIS. Lightly battered in bread crumbs without stuffing. Crab cake was exquisite. The crab cake tasted very fresh and was about the size of my palm, definitely shareable between 2 people. This was actually my favorite of the night. 8oz Center Cut Filet Mignon (4/5, With truffle butter, mushrooms & mashed potatoes): I'm not a big steak person but this was cooked to perfection! The waiter offered truffle butter or mushrooms as steak complements. I decided to go with the truffle butter. Apparently, you can add truffle butter to anything in Brenner's by the way. For the sides, we ordered mushrooms and mashed potatoes. Mashed potatoes were a bit dry but perfectly seasoned. Mashed potatoes tasted better when you mixed the mushrooms which were full of flavor. Croissant Bread Pudding (4/5, Dried apricots, blueberries, ice cream, dulce de leche, and crème anglaise sauce): This bread pudding tasted somewhat like a dough but was fantastic! The apricots and blueberries were incorporated within the bread pudding, made it quite delectable. It wasn't the best I've had though. Definitely recommend this with extra ice cream scoop. Triple Chocolate Mousse Cake (2/5, White & semi-sweet chocolate mousse with chocolate cake): This was eh.... nothing stood out for me. It's great for chocolate lovers. Our waiter was great at first but gradually declined with his service. Personable and offered his recommendations for appetizers. However, there were a few times when the wine touched the bottom. The thing that bothered us though was the timing from the food to the check. The time to get our check afterwards was the worst. We probably had to wait 10 minutes before we reminded him for the check again and another 10 minutes for him to bring back the card + check.  In conclusion: Traditional ambiance. Decent steakhouse fare with beef quality. I would come back for the crab cake!","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,brenners-steakhouse-houston,brenners-steakhouse-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brenners-steakhouse-houston?start=0,Richard P.,"Lubbock, TX",1,5,,,8/4/17,This is my favorite steakhouse!

Inside was quite noisy as well, it's a popular and very busy place.Another one was 2 gentlemen smoking cigars at the table nearby. We were not directly next to them and I felt truly sorry for the people at the table right next to them. Still we left with a lasting headache, itch in the eyes and tinging in the throat.

She and I started the celebration last Sunday in Belize. We returned to the US to cap it off with a weekend of partying and dining with friends which started on Friday and ended with dinner and another night of dancing on Saturday night. We made reservations for a private room while we were still relaxing in Belize. I would suggest reserving a private room if your having dinner with a large group. As our evening wore on and the libations kept coming our conversation got quite festive in keeping with boisterous laughter and colorful story telling. The private room allowed for a comfortable setting in which to create more indelible memories for us and our group of friends. From the moment we walked through the door the staff was delightful and attentive. While waiting for our group to arrive my wife and I chose to wait at the bar where we began our evening with two of our favorite cocktails. An Apple Martini for my wife and a Long Island ice tea for me. The drinks were spot on from that point and throughout the evening. One of my wife's bestie went out on a limb and tried a Red Dragonfly cocktail later in the evening and described it as an exquisite concoction which danced on her tongue. We also ordered two bottles of wine for a toast by the suggestion of the house sommelier. He gave excellent directions as to what the ladies wanted in a wine that evening. Our server was very attentive and gave an informative breakdown of the menu. I'm sorry I can't recall her name for she was so enjoyable especially when she explained truffle butter to us. Upon her suggestion I tried it on my 6oz filet mignon and it was a delicious compliment to the meat. I'm posting pictures of all of our dishes for they were all so very scrumptious and delectable. Compliments to the chef. We also had the crab cakes and calamari appetizers which were also delicious. Crab cakes were so good that we ordered two more servings.

There are much better places to get great steak, with better service, for about the same price.We started with lobster bisque. It is good, but needs a bit more lobster in it.Next up was the crab cake. This is absolutely delicious. You only get one, but it is big enough to share between 2 people. I would order 2 and make this my dinner. It is that good. There is more stuffing than lump crab (seems to be the Landry's way), but it is still this best thing on the menu.The Caesar salad was good, but the dressing was not ""eggy"" enough for me. It also lacked the good salty flavor from anchovies. The wedge salad looked to be the better choice. The wedge can be split and shared if you are trying to keep it light.I ordered the 10 ounce center cut filet. This was a bit of a let down. Aged steak has an intense flavor. This filet did not. Yes, it was tender, but it did have a large streak of sinew running through it. Not what I expect for a $38 piece of meat.The $9 side of green beans were very good. They were cooked perfectly and well seasoned.Dessert consisted of apple strudel and the lemon tart. We decided to elevate our apple strudel and ordered a side of brandy alexander to go along with it. The strudel was the better dessert. We mixed the ice cream from the strudel plate with the alexander and then used it as a dipping sauce. This made it even better. Do it! After the strudel was gone, we were all spooning up sauce to finish every drop.The service was a bit off. Drinks sat empty. Plates were slow to be cleared, leaving us to try to stack empty plates to create room on the table. Just not what you expect when paying $100 per person for a nice dinner.I am sorry to see this place going down hill. Don't get me wrong, you can get a nice meal here.

We had reservations here this evening for my husband's birthday. Thanks to the always unpredictable Houston traffic, we actually arrived about 40 minutes (!) early. We expected to wait a while, but after one drink and about 15 minutes, a hostess let us know we could be seated if we wanted. Our server Marian introduced himself, promptly brought out drinks, and explained the specials and highlights from the menu. He provided excellent service all evening, and we greatly appreciated him. We started with the crab cake appetizer, which was easily one of the best crab cakes I've had in very long time. No breadcrumbs or other fillers substituting for seafood, just densely packed lump crabmeat. Next, my husband had the garden salad with cilantro ranch dressing, which he enjoyed very much. I had the lobster bisque, which I really enjoyed. In contrast to many of the bisques out there that are overly reliant on heavy cream or sherry, this was a darker and richer bisque with nothing to mask the strong lobster flavor and tender chunks of lobster meat. I would definitely order this again. For entrees, he had the 16 oz ribeye medium rare and a baked potato, and I had the 8 oz filet medium rare with the Oscar topping and a baked potato. Both steaks were cooked perfectly and incredibly tender and flavorful. The filet was so rich and flavorful I definitely did not need the Oscar topping, but the topping was very good. I also took home a piece of triple chocolate mousse cake, which I am enjoying now as I write this. :-) Overall, this was an excellent meal and experience in a lovely atmosphere, and I look forward to our next meal at Brenner's.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,brenners-steakhouse-houston,brenners-steakhouse-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brenners-steakhouse-houston?start=40,O.D A.,"Energy Corridor, Houston, TX",0,78,44,,11/16/16,"Great crab cakes!, had the filet mignon with mash potatoes and mac & cheese which was all delicious.

The service was the best part of the experience. We went for NYE 2014 and they had a 4 course $95 price fix.Food- 1.5 StarsFirst Course- I got the lobster rockafeller and hubby got a bacon wrapped salmon fritter. The Lobster rockafeller was blah, it looked really pretty but lacked any distinguishing flavors and it was a cold lobster salad, which is odd when it's billed as rockafeller which is a hot dish. The fritter was OK but the bacon was a bit overwhelming and muddied the whole thing up. A few people at the table had the veal meatballs and were sorely disappointed, said they were dry and lacking flavor.Second Course- I got the lobster bisque, which was more tomato soupish that I would expect a lobster bisque ever to be. There was some good chunks of lobster in the soup. Overall I wanted a much creamier and more lobster flavored soup. The wedge salad was blah, I could do better at home. Third Course- The only redeeming overall course. The Golden Tile was very well cooked and had a delicious sauce. The other people at the table were very happy with their filet.Fourth Course- The dessert was so awful overall it was laughable. The bread pudding was fine, but I have had much much better at much lesser places. The Smores was just so bad I can't get it out of my mind. The graham ""cracker"" was dry and not flavored well. The chocolate was barely melted and the bagged grocery store marshmallow was cold and looked to be quickly burnt with a brulee torch. I can't remember having a more disappointing dessert at a restaurant. Drinks- 2 StarsOk bar drinks but nothing stood out. The wine menu has some nice options as does the beer menu.Service- 5 StarsOur waitress was excellent in every way.Atmosphere- 3 StarsFeels like a nice steakhouse. You have to walk through a garden area to get to some seating areas which is kinda cool.Value- 1 StarThe food sucked overall, way over priced for me.","alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,brenners-steakhouse-houston,brenners-steakhouse-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brenners-steakhouse-houston?start=40,C F.,"Cypress, TX",0,4,,,2/24/17,"For my wife and I, this is our favorite restaurant.

We started off with appetizer platters, which isn't on the menu, but it's essentially a large platter with a mix of different appetizers for us to sample. It included fried calamari with tomato citrus jam for dipping, blackened jumbo scallops with onion strings, and jumbo lump crab cakes with crab meat on top. The crab cakes were delicious, but I thought the scallops were a bit too salty for my taste. I'm not a fan of calamari so I didn't try any. Some ordered from the HRW 2014 menu while others ordered off the regular menu. Trying to decide between the gulf red snapper and the chilean sea bass, I ended up picking the sea bass based on the server's recommendation. The portion was surprisingly big, and the sea bass tasted very fresh just like the server had promised. It was so good that I ended up finishing the entire entree, which was not my original intent. Some of the others ordered the 8 oz prime top sirloin filet that came with french fries, and they claimed it to be pretty good as well. I didn't order any dessert but based on my observations, the chocolate mousse cake was everyone's favorite. I did notice that the HRW portion of the cake was three times smaller than if you were to order the same off the regular menu. The service was great. The servers were constantly in and out of our room checking up on us and our drinks. They even let us keep the birthday cupcakes we had brought in their fridge. Overall, the ambiance, food, and service were great and comparable to the other steakhouses around town, but nothing about it really stood out.

We were seated in a room off to the side, which worked perfectly for grandparents who are hard of hearing. Our waiter was professional and polite. He was extremely pleasant from start to finish and went above and beyond to ensure we were satisfied with our experience. COURSE #1: Our table started with the lobster bisque, calamari and Caesar salad. The salad looked good, but nothing special. Calamari had about a dozen pieces of nicely fried seafood-no marinara, but rather a mayo-based dipping sauce. The lobster bisque was the crowd favorite. It was a large serving with big chunks of lobster meat, was delightfully warm and the flavor was delicious. Would recommend! COURSE #2: definitely get the chicken fried tenderloin! The portion is embarrassingly huge, restaurant week or not! The bacon gravy is to die for. Only one person at our table selected this and we were all drooling. Luckily, the portion was so large, we were all able to try it. One other diner selected the salmon. She commented that the spinach risotto was delicious. The rest of us had the filet. It literally melted in your mouth, and the peppercorn sauce perfectly complemented the meat. The asparagus and mashed potatoes served with it paled in comparison to the filet, though those were tasty as well. My only complaint would be that the steak wasn't necessarily cooked to order. My medium well was still very pink in the middle, almost as pink as my husbands who ordered medium rare. In fact, everyone's looked very pink despite other requests. I didn't bother to send it back, and it was still just as delicious. COURSE #3: 7/8 of us got the Apple streudel, upon the recommendation of the waiter. It was delightfully warm and decadent and paired nicely with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. We were already pretty full from the first two courses, so the smaller serving size was perfect. The key lime pie was also well received. Didn't get to see what the ice cream cookie sandwich looked like. We do wish there had been something more chocolate-y than the cookie sandwich!

The crab cakes were a lump crab and had very little if any filler like so often happens, topped with even more lump crab and a very light sauce over the top, by far one of the best crab cakes I have had outside of Maryland.Next we shared a BLT Wedge salad that had just enough of all the right toppings, bacon, blue cheese and tomatoes to make it a great segway to our main course.For the main course we shared a 10oz bone in filet cooked to a perfect medium rare and served with a side of asparagus, which we chose to not have topped with anything but simply cooked with the salt/pepper and spices Brenner's uses.Food was a solid 4+ and the ambiance was classic up scale steak and seafood restaurant, with the people dressed from casual casual to very nice in suits and dresses.

It's just too good. My husband wanted to try something new for our anniversary, but he hadn't been to Brenner's in 10 years, so with a recent change in the menu it was new to him.We had a beautiful view of the garden, but wished we had requested a table outside since it wasn't too hot. There are a few tables in the garden as well as a comfy seating area where you can wait for your table. We both decided to try something a bit different which meant not ordering a steak. The dinner entrees consisted of what I would consider home-style cooking (meatloaf, ribs, chicken) but with their chef's own little twist. The kobe meatloaf with hoisin topping and sweet potatoes didn't disappoint. I usually dislike sweet potatoes, but the hoisin made them match perfectly and added a creamy texture. I don't know what it was about the potatoes au gratin, but they were much more savory than at similar restaurants we have been to and I found myself going over my typical spoonful serving. For dessert I ordered their chocolate mousse cake, which was a thin layer of chocolate cake, a layer of chocolate mousse, and a layer of white chocolate mousse topped with fudge. The white chocolate mousse tasted more like a butter cream, but since I love butter cream this was fine with me.And last, I am a salad person and I really enjoyed their salad. At many places, the dinner salad is large enough to be dinner, but not here.

This time we ordered:*crab salad-it was just crab meat on top of shredded lettuce on top of crushed ice served with remoulade sauce. For $16?!! Umm never again Brenner's. Shame on you for serving this boring, overpriced app. ***Lobster bisque-not your mamas bisque! This bisque was more like a soup since it was not creamy and seemed to have more of a tomato base. The broth (as I like to call it) had a few pieces of lobster-which upon further investigation looked more like crawfish but I couldn't prove it-and no other ingredients. I'm giving it 3 stars because the broth was delicious! Try dipping the table bread into it! Mmm mmm good. ****green salad with beets-yumm!! I didn't eat this dish but I tried a bite and I can say that the shredded beets on top were awesome. I love beets but not too many-and this was just the right amount and preparation. ***scallops and chorizo with pea purée. Yum! The scallops were cooked to perfection and the chorizo was a nice accompaniment. The pea purée was a little bland but still edible. I wouldn't have put so much on the plate. I could also see the purée separating and it left a ring of water around it which wasn't very appealing to look at. Still, 3 stars. ****By far, the best dish of the night was the truffled, crab, Mac n cheese we ordered by request. This is not on the menu but since the waiter told us they could add truffle butter to anything-hey why not on our crab Mac n cheese?! The kitchen staff admitted to the waiter they made some for them selves and are going to recommend putting it on the menu! Just a little truffle butter though since it can be overpowering. Yum yum yum!! Creamy, cheesy, truffly deliciousness. Oh, btw they make THE BEST old fashioned I've ever tasted. The waiter told me the secret recipe but after all that food and drinks I forgot.

Our party of five fit well at a table in the center of the room (no bigger than our living room). The draw here is the food, its preparation, and outstanding service. The wine list is large; prices are on a par with other fine dining restaurants, but they have a Sunday special where, for the expensive wines, the price is half off. We took advantage of that, and discovered a Chardonnay [Pahlmeyer] we'll buy for ourselves, which we'd never ordinarily have risked paying full restaurant price for. We loved the large, delicious sides; each is enough for four people, or two very hungry guys. We've only ever had the shrimp cocktail appetizer (the danger here, as usual, is that you'll fill up on the appetizers before you even start the meal), but looking at other appetizers on other tables suggests they are probably outstanding. There was nothing special about the bread, except that the two types were delicious, and, unlike many places, pre-sliced appropriately. It's always surprising when a high-end restaurant gets soup or salad wrong (how hard could that be?) but both soups and all salads here were just perfect, and very generous (more danger of overeating before the main course). This visit, we had two different steaks (bone-in, oscar-topped ribeye and filet mignon) and two different fish dishes (red snapper and salmon). The filets were wonderful, very thick, and perfectly prepared to order; the extra au poivre sauce was delicious (and not too salty or spicy as so many others seem to do far too frequently). The bone-in ribeye steak was as good as any I have anywhere else in any five-star rated restaurant, also perfectly prepared to order. The folks in my party who had the red snapper and salmon also felt they were as good as anywhere else in memory.

As we walked through the beautiful garden area we saw diners sitting next to the windows. There were a few tables open but we got stuck in the business room on the back where it's mostly business parties of 5+. First sign of their inability to listen as my need to make this a special evening for my wife.We ordered wine, our appetizer and food. We were maybe 15 min there and I had two small pieces from bread basket...that's when our waitress came and took our bread without asking. Similarly, we were 3/4 finished with our appetizer and again took it without asking. At this level of dining I shouldn't have to tell someone ""don't take that just yet"" I expect that at chilly's or similar place. My issue is that not only did she come around only to take or bring us food/drinks but she did not bother to check on us regularly to see how we were.I've honestly had better service at Texas Roadhouse and Longhorn Steakhouse. To be fair we saw other tables getting very good service, for what ever reason we just didn't see our waitress much.Next our meals came and we were again disappointed, my wife had the 8oz Prime Top Sirloin and I had the Chillean Sea Bass. The steak was so so and I've had Tillapia that tasted better than the Sea Bass.I was so shocked and surprised, we've been to Taste of Texas, Flemmings, Perry's and both my wife and I have been told Brenners is much better than all these...wrong!!I will not recommend Brenners to anyone and I'd go further into saying that these other steakhouses I just mentioned would be worth your money. My wife and I usually prefer going to Chaumagaucha or Fogo De Chao for an excellent dining experience and great service!Overall ratings...

When we arrived (on time) the hostess informed us, without apology or explanation, that we would have to wait from 30 to 45 minutes for a window table. We did not want to wait that long and agreed to be seated elsewhere but asked specifically not to be seated near the high traffic area at the kitchen entrance.

Once we were seated we noticed that there was an empty table near the window and away from the kitchen. Exactly where we had requested a month in advance. That table remained empty for a full 45 minutes before anyone was seated there. The noise level in the restaurant was so high that we could barely have a conversation or hear our waiter. The steak was alright, but just alright and at this price point should have been much better.

Nothing short of AMAZING! First the amuse bouche, crusted scallop with asparagus topped with a bacon chipotle cream sauce, was tantalizing! Second, the other heavier appetizers followed-bacon wrapped quail with some sort of delicious sauce, crusted goat cheese over fruit with crisps, and a phenomenal crab cake. The crab cake was our favorite from this course, but they were all magazine worthy! On to the main courses, the filets could not have been more perfectly prepared-juicy, aged and melts in your mouth just like butter, chicken fried filet (if you're not from the south, and even if you are, Brenner's has mastered deep frying on this one), put it this way if I was going to die from a heart attack I would want this meal to have caused it so I could die knowing that this was the best fried food EVER, and the bone in Ribeye which my husband enjoyed, barely sharing, so he obviously enjoyed it. The small morsel I did receive from him was stellar-flavorful with a fantastic texture and superb cut with bone, yummmmm. Here's the lick your plate at a white linen restaurant moment-the MUSHROOM CREAM SAUCE-kudos to Executive Chef Jason Cole, after strong discussion about pouring this over anything and everything, the consensus is that this sauce is so good you could pour it over cardboard and think that it was a delicacy. This mushroom sauce, creamy and smooth with just the right consistency, was the best accompaniment I have ever experienced at any restaurant in the world that I have tried (yes, I meant world, not state or country). The sides were all fresh and delicious-perfectly seasoned and prepared spinach (I had a second serving, considering I don't generally care for cooked spinach, the second serving should say it all) and yes I did have a little mushroom sauce on it, Mac n Cheese-yummy, my favorite pasta is Cavatappi, and real mashed potatoes-perfectly buttery and seasoned. Now onto dessert, a sampler-the apple strudel (it was gone before I was able to taste, but that's okay because I ate more than my share of the bread pudding), the warm bread pudding-loved the crescent roll type dough with the apricots and blueberries topped with ice cream (this was my favorite dessert), and the chocolate mousse cake (chocolate lover's must have). The cappuccinos and coffees were tasty and served hot. Our service was superb, every piece of cutlery replaced correctly without notice, nothing was ever asked for because he foresaw our needs before we could ask, spot on timing between courses and just personable enough yet very professional! I certainly hope there's a response that will let everyone know our server's name so they may request him-he was fantastic, but because we didn't have to ask for anything by the time we'd returned home I'd forgotten his name. Thank you to all of the managers, waitstaff, and especially our waiter and Executive Chef Jason Cole for making one of our last meals in Houston a most memorable life experience.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,brenners-steakhouse-houston,brenners-steakhouse-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brenners-steakhouse-houston?start=100,Lauren K.,"Irvine, CA",25,29,,,5/19/13,"The service was GREAT!

After we got our car valet parked we went inside and the hostess walked us out another door and through their garden to another small dining area with a few tables.

Our food came out shortly after that and unfortunately I was pretty disappointed in the chicken, but I guess that was my fault for trusting a self-claimed ""famous"" fried chicken than go with my gut and stick with the steak. Maybe it's because I've been spoiled by other restaurants' fried chicken that I went into the meal with already high expectations, but there really wasn't anything impressive about it. The mashed potatoes that came as the side however was really good! I love mashed potatoes as well and these definitely didn't disappoint.

I came here for my friends birthday, if it wasn't for the birthday girl I doubt I would ever come to a place like this. I want to start by saying our waiter was a joke, he should not be working in a place like this, he was rude from beginning to end. I arrived a little later then the other guests, so I did not get his name until I received my check, I believe it was Maurice, apparently the manager came over and told us we had the best server in the house, I laughed a little because I thought that was a joke, he was the opposite of everything the manager said he was. When he started to take orders he took mine first and skipped my friend next to me and went down 2 person and everyone looked confused, and he said he was taking the ladies orders first..ummm excuse me the person next to me is a LADY, he probably thought we were sharing because I ordered quite a few things. I had the ahi tuna, and the crab came as an appetizer and a filet mignon as my main course. He kept asking me if I wanted the appetizers as my meal, I said no I would like it as my appetizer, and he gave me an attitude questioning me if I did want it as an appetizer..by the way his tone of voice was not very pleasing. The whole night he kept raising his voice he did not talk calm what so ever. He turned a fun moment into a tragedy each time he came by our table, it would get awkward and very quiet and we would just stare at one another. Towards the end he asked if anyone wanted dessert, I am not a dessert person I hate sweets, so do not ask me more then one time it could get annoying. When the bill came out he put it all together without asking us how we wanted to spit it. So we told him everyone is split checks on what they had. His response was a high puffing noise and said I wish you guys had told me earlier because now I do not know how I could split the checks, and he looked back at his paper that he took his order on and said maybe I could figure it out, but it will take a very long time. EXCUSE your job is so hard that you could not think of what we ordered when you went in ""circles"" to take our orders. That was very unprofessional of him, he must not be very good at his job if he can not figure it out in the POS SYSYTEM, I am a waitress myself and when I have parties bigger then what he had it is not difficult at all if you put in orders by seats or name or what ever the method, and if he split the orders by person when we each ordered.

It's once in a blue moon that we dine out at a high end place. Overall, I would probably give this place 3.5 stars. It's a little hidden treasure right off of the Katy Freeway and close to the Beltway. It's one of those homey type house settings. We got to sit by the window which had a beautiful view of the garden/scenery. People were out there taking pictures like it was their wedding or senior pictures! Anyhow, the service was great..the food was ok. We had half a bottle of white wine which cost $58 (yikes!) We tried out the jumbo seared scallops and the ahi tuna for appetizers. Scallops were a bit salty, the ahi tuna was quite good and it had bbq sauce as part of their garnish. So I came there wanting a ribeye and the only size they had was a 16 oz which is way too big for a little person like me. So the waiter mentioned the bone in ribeye as their special of the night. I thought..ok..with the bone in, maybe it would be a little less meat. When I got it, it was still pretty big. It looked like a big ol drumstick from the Flintstones era! I didn't wanna be ghetto and ask for A1 sauce, so I asked for steak sauce. Waiter came back out with a trio sauce...which none of them I cared for. My guy ordered their fish special which he didn't really have any complaints about. As our side dishes we ordered some kind of german potatoes? It's pretty much like fried potato chips with some caramelized onions on the bottom. They were pretty good. We also ordered creamed spinach which I didn't touch b/c I'm not into cheese. But my guy said it was good, tasted like spinach artichoke dip. For dessert, we ordered creme brulee. We asked them to torch it a little extra longer since I looooooove the sugary top. And boy did they do that! I was satisfied. It was a big portion, too! I ordered some Kalua w/coffee..eh.. I'd pass on that. It sucked.But the bill came, and crap...it was like $250 before tip! Geeeeeez!! Found out they charged $12 for the freakin steak sauces and my not so great steak was $54...certainly not worth it. I think I'm used to my ribeyes at Saltgrass where it's seasoned with their spices and butter that this one was just solely red meat. So, if you plan on coming here, make reservations, and be sure to bring a lot of moolah b/c this will break your wallet. Remember, nothing is free! Fair warning!

It melts in your mouth, a knife is optional!!! Get the sides, they are family sized so don't order a bunch of them, you won't eat it all!

If you do not request it, and you do not make a reservation, you will not be seated there or have the option unless you are there ""all the time.""

Unfortunately, we would have been better off at Outback. Our reservation was for 5pm and we arrived a few minutes before 5. The hostess was nice and told us that we could sit at the bar and have a cocktail before dinner. We sat down and the bartender informed us that he wasn't ready to start serving yet which was ok since we weren't drinking. We finally got seated at our table at 5:10pm and ordered our iced teas. The waiter spilled part of my tea on my glass when he set it down hard, to bad some of it splashed on my white sweater. Ok accidents happen, I got that. We ordered the seared Ahi Tuna for an appetizer. It was ok, but not great. My husband ordered the Wedge Salad which not only looked unappetizing, it turned out to be just awful. My house salad was good and the ranch dressing was divine. Next up was our steaks. A medium ribeye ($42.00) and a medium NY Strip ($46.00). They both came out well done so we sent them back to be recooked. Unfortunately, the second time they came out only slightly less well done than the first time. We opted to eat them instead of sending them back a second time. Then came time for dessert. We were cautiously optimistic when we saw they had Apple Strudel. Sadly, it tasted like they had microwaved a hostess apple pie and dumped some ice cream on it. The service really wasn't great either.

It was the WORST ""fine"" dining establishment we have ever been to. The ""event coordinator"" Tammy neglected to inform us that they could not seat our party of 20 together and that we would be in the main dining area, not one of the banquet rooms. We made the reservation a month in advance and indicated that we would have approximately 20 people, she said that was fine and we discussed the menu. Tammy made no mention of not being able to seat all of us together. We also confirmed the number of people the week of the party, still no mention that we would not be seated together. We were seated in the TINY main dining area, not a party room (again, there was no mention of this when we booked our reservation with Tammy) 16 people sat at a table that really should have accommodated 12. We were smashed together like sardines. I am not exaggerating, each chair touched the other and it had a picnic table feel, the chairs made one long bench on either side of the table. The last 4 guests to arrive had to sit at a completely separate table for 4 behind our table. Tammy was there and we spoke to her about the seating problems but she made no apologies and said there was nothing they could do, all the party rooms were booked. Of course we were stuck there, it was too late to move our large group of 20 to another restaurant. The dining area was so packed the waiters could barely squeeze between the tables and were constantly reaching over our heads and across the table to serve us. When the food finally arrived, it was mediocre at best. The steaks were dry and cold, as if they had been sitting in the kitchen for quite a while. They were not dry as in over cooked, just dry as if they were sitting out too long. The mashed potatoes were also hard and cold and had too much garlic. The desserts were average, Saltgrass (another Landry's restaurant) would have been just as good for half the price. When I brought my concerns to the manager's attention, he said he would ""look into it"" and discuss the situation with Tammy and the kitchen.
