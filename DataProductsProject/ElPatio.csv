We had hoped to sit in Club No Minor, and although there was plenty of space open, the hostess insisted she had too many reservations to seat us there. We were quick to order alcohol and waters and all of the service staff was extremely attentive. I never had an empty chip basket or salsa bowl in front of me. The corn sauce on the el patio enchiladas was some of the best I've ever had and the chicken flautas were hearty and delicious. We also ordered beef and chicken fajitas, which came with a generous serving of onions, peppers and tortillas. Our server closed our tab after we ordered food, but didn't mind throwing away the printed receipt to let us order more margs.

We went here for happy hour one day after it was recommended to us by friends.Drinks:I got the sangria and my boyfriend had a regular frozen margarita. The sangria was delicious and some of the best I have ever had. The margarita was okay, but almost tasted like frozen tequila. It needed something to make it a little sweeter, which is where the blue margarita comes in. It is one of the regular margs with blue curacao. It was pretty good and I would get it again.Food:We started with the ceviche which was good, but noting special. The chips and salsa were just ok. I had the carne guisada and my boyfriend had the fajita beef burrito. Both were alright.

As you immediately enter El Patio, there is a door on your right that leads to the restaurant within a restaurant. Located off of Westheimer, El Patio is located in a shopping center with a small parking lot. Unfortunately, it's valet only which is really unnecessary but I found parking on a side street. Club No Minor has a speakeasy vibe with dim lighting and intimate surroundings. There are several tables and a bar and there is a pretty good happy hour menu on both food and drinks until 6:30. When it comes to drinks, the blue margaritas are highly recommended and they pack a punch! I had one blue marg and then we decided to share a pitcher which can be seen as either a good idea or a bad idea. Safe to say, surviving at work on a Friday after the blue margarita tornado has been a challenge. On the food side, we shared the taquitas (mini taquitos served with a cilantro sauce and sour cream) and the chicken quesadillas. Both were pretty lackluster, below average Mexican food. We also enjoyed some chips and queso which is always good no matter where you go. One of the interesting things on the menu is the Felix section. Felix used to be a popular restaurant located where Uchi is now. The restaurant tragically burned down and some of the former cooks now work at El Patio. They have several of their menu items at El Patio including their famous queso. Less like queso and more like chunky and greasy American cheese, I was not a big fan even though my friend loves it. Definitely different than any queso you've ever had so maybe it's a hit or miss depending on the person. On the service side, good service with one hiccup. They check on you periodically to make sure you have everything you want which was a job well done. We ordered our pitcher of blue margarita at 6:28 before happy hour ended. Our server took out his phone to look at the time and seemed to not want to accept our order before he abided. Bro, if happy hour ends at 6:30 I can sure as hell order a happy hour menu at 6:28. In fact, most restaurants won't bat an eye at hooking you up past happy hour, give or take a few minutes.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,el-patio-restaurant-and-club-houston-2,el-patio-restaurant-and-clhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/el-patio-restaurant-and-club-houston-2?start=0,el-patio-restaurant-and-club-houston-2,David B.

First of all, they have a real club on premises. Yep! No lie. Club No Minors means exactly what the name implies. No minors are allowed. You must be 21 and up. The club is a lot of fun. There is a great group of people who hang out here. The margaritas are strong and the beer is cold. There's a full bar if you decide you want something else. The setting is similar to the restaurant setting, so you can order your food inside the club too. The music is loud, so if you want to have an intimate conversation, stick to the restaurant. They also take reservations, so call ahead.The restaurant is very nice. This is a small establishment with a variety of tables for small or large groups. The small patio section is very nice when the weather permits. The food is always fresh and served piping hot. They allow you to substitute items and customize your order. They aim to please! I love their rice because it's not the typical Spanish rice made with a tomato base. Their rice is more of a lightly seasoned white rice with cilantro. It is absolutely delicious! The music playing over the P.A. system is just the right level so you can talk to the people at your table and not have to yell. The waiters were on top of things! Great customer service and very friendly people. For all my alcohol drinkers, they have a wide variety of beer, several different types of margaritas and a full bar so you can create your own drink. Happy Hour is Monday through Friday from 4:00PM to 6:00PM and Saturday and Sunday from 11:00AM to 6:00PM. Also, there is a ""beer of the day"" every day of the week at a discounted price.The parking lot small and shared with a couple of other businesses, and there are several signs that designates parking for those businesses. My advice is to get there early to ensure a parking spot. I've gone for lunch during the week, and happy hour on Saturday's. There was always plenty of parking during those times.Whenever you decide to go, I'm sure you will enjoy the atmosphere, the drinks and especially the food.

Made a reservation in restaurant (they were all booked for club no minor) for a table of 10 making sure they understood it was for the HH. No problem, they said. From the first moment we walked in our server had a grumpy attitude. He was an older gentleman with a limp. We forged ahead determined to have a good time regardless. We ordered off the HH menu and the regular menu throughout the evening on top of pitchers and shots. Despite this we could not turn the server's mood around. He tossed menus at people, grumbled under his breath whenever anyone asked him for anything. Still, we sallied forth enjoying the company of our table. At one point one person had to leave early so he paid the tab up to that moment. We started a new one after his departure. Then later on some people wanted to pay their parts. Cards were produced to pay the bill. They were swiped. The slips were signed. Someone threw in some cash for a tip. But we were still there and in fact ordered more! The grumpy waiter came to collect the cc slips at some point. He actually opened the book to look, walked to one of our guests and demanded more money! My coworker, being the non confrontational person that he is pulled out his wallet. Upon seeing what was happening I interjected and asked what was going on. He said he wanted more money. Excuse me? I looked at the waiter and told him we were not done with our bill yet, we were not leaving. He looked at me and said, 'but I'm leaving!' Ummm ok. As a former server I understand the frustration of a table not leaving at end of your shift. But what a strange shift as it was mid-dinner service on a Friday night. No where near the restaurant closing. And then he said he lives off tips and has bills to pay. Again, as a former server, I understand the crappy pay. Hence why you try to offer the best customer service and hospitality you can to your table to earn a higher tip! Anyway the whole damn scenario caused this shock once the whole table understood what had just happened. But by then he had ripped another $20 from my friend's hand and managed to trot off quickly despite his limp. We did ask to speak to management at this point. They did nothing but half-heartedly apologize on his behalf promising they would speak to him about his behavior. Also I don't even think it was actually a mgr, just another server. According to him there was nothing they could do and he was already gone. They just didn't really seem to care that their patrons had just experienced an absurd situation in their restaurant. We all loved the margaritas and food was ok but due to this server, who is supposed to represent the establishment, we'll take our business elsewhere.","alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,el-patio-restaurant-and-club-houston-2,el-patio-restaurant-and-clhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/el-patio-restaurant-and-club-houston-2?start=20,el-patio-restaurant-and-club-houston-2,Arnold L.,"Pearland, TX",0,5,,,10/15/16,"We visited El Patio Resturant, it was so noisy, we thought we were in Chucky Cheese.

(you can ask them for no meat and they're more than happy to do it!)Quesadillas: I didn't try the quesadillas, but I did try the pico de gallo that came with it and it was AWESOME...

We couldn't tell if perhaps the meat was bad, or some kind of weird seasoning, or what was so strange about it, but it left a very bad taste in my mouth and I got a a very strange feeling (for lack of better way to define how the taste impacted me --as strange as that sounds) from it --it was sort of creepy and filled with despair. It definitely did not taste like beef, or pork or chicken. I have no idea what it was, but they tasted unlike any enchiladas I have every eaten in my life. I asked to the waiter to exchange it for some fajita nachos. He brought those out and they weren't a lot better. How does one screw up a nacho, for Pete's sake?

The only nice thing I have to say about this place is that they have a decent amount of parking. The service, food, and establishment are just awful and I have no intention of ever walking back through their doors again.I met up with a friend here for a happy hour of margaritas and Mexican food. The weather was still really beautiful, so we decided to sit out on the patio. It's a good thing we did, because the interior was a bit depressing looking with cheap fluorescent lighting, no windows, and old red pleather booth seating and chairs. There were no other customers on the patio, so we had it to ourselves. I don't know if this was a blessing or a curse because our waiter continued to bother us every few minutes. We came for a relaxed happy hour where we could sit and catch up while taking our time dining. Instead, we were constantly interrupted and bothered by our waiter to hurry up and order. Maybe some of their regular patrons want to get their food as fast as possible, eat, and leave, but that's not how I operate. I found that the lack of observation by our waiter that we were here to relax was entirely distracting and downright irritating.I ordered up an El Patio margarita which tasted like it was made with cheap tequila and premixed margarita flavor. In other words, I could have made the same thing at home with none of the attitude. We also decided to get started with an appetizer of nachos from their happy hour menu. Between the bad margarita and pathetic nachos, I was second thinking whether I wanted to eat dinner here. The nachos were just ok, not great, but not awful. For the most part, they were pretty forgettable.The final straw for me was when the waiter kept trying to remove our appetizer plate even though we told him several times that we weren't done. His last attempt to remove the plate was as though he were telling us to leave. He picked up the plate with a couple nachos still on it and set the bill between us. I looked at my friend and said that I took that as we needed to leave and our business wasn't wanted.We ended up paying the bill, not tipping very well, and drove to Lupe Tortilla to finish having a relaxed dinner with no pressure to hurry up and leave. I don't get why people would even bother with this place when there are hundreds of Mexican, TexMex, and Taqueria restaurants throughout the city. This place is just wrong in every way.

A separate room was set aside as the club and membership cards were issued to patrons who paid a set fee for liquor. The door to the club bore the name ""Club Villa Sana"" in attractive wood lettering. Unfortunately, as the club grew in popularity, the ""Villa Sana"" part of the sign was taken more than once. Tiring of replacing the sign, only one word ""Club"" remained. Beneath this sign, a smaller sign - ""No Minors"" was placed. In time, everyone began to call the room ""Club No Minors"". The club is noted for its potent Margaritas - no, we do NOT use Everclear - and the lively Mariachis who play three to four times a week.side note: cabs are NOT opposed after a visit to the ""club."" also, be prepared to feel at first that the blue concoctions are just a little to tasty to be strong, and that this Caroline girl must be a huge lightweight.... give it about 30 mins.

It had something called ""chile con queso"" that came on a dish called ""Felix's All Time Special"". And that's what I ate for the first God-knows-how-many years of my life. The thing they called ""Chile con Queso"" was in fact a crispy flat corn tortilla with their queso on top. THAT's what that dish was to me for years. Sometime later, I learned that one could simply order a BOWL of said cheesiness. This bowl came filled with oily cheesy goodness, and when you were done with the queso, there was still quite a bit of oil at the bottom of the bowl. This effect is what you get when they use something called ACTUAL CHEESE instead of Velveeta.My whole family grew up eating this. My sister even spent like $300 or more to have a whole table set-up at her wedding reception that had nothing but chips and tons of Felix's Chile con Queso.So, when I was called into town for a catering gig, and was asked to make the famous queso for it, I needed to get my bearings with this recipe again. Fortunately, El Patio still makes this ancient mystical recipe. Oddly, I'd never been to El Patio, even though my parents had, and it's been around about as long as Felix's was. I was in for a treat. The Queso, while not as spicy as I remember, was decadent. The salsa was warm and spicy. The margarita was blue, but not in that electric fake color with sweet and sour way. It was strong and tasted like...well, like a margarita should.I got the crawfish enchiladas. Now, for a nearly 50 year old place, I didn't expect such things to be on their menu, but I guess their menu keeps expanding over the years. Still, this was done old-school. The plate arrived hotter than any plate has reason to be. Just radiating heat so that you really wanted to touch it just to see how badly it might burn you. The red pepper sauce lay slightly broken into the cheese that oozed across the plate. Everywhere, there were pools of cheese, sauce and grease. Fuckin hells yeah, I say. Let me at em. I even thought about adding a little salsa for heat, but they actually have a nice slow burn on this dish which impressed me even more. So, now when I don't want to be healthy and I'm in Houston, I know where to go. And for all you Austin peeps, if you know a place that's this kind of tex mex awesomeness, tell me!

It had that classic Mexican restaurant feel to it. The small chile con queso was okay. Way bigger than what two people need. But it was chunky and congealed easily. The chips were thin and crispy, salsa runny. I got the Sissy Margarita, which was pretty good. Kind of sweet. I tasted my husband's House Margarita to see the difference, his was WAY stronger. He had to wait for the ice to melt for it not to taste like straight tequila. I got the regular cheese enchiladas plate. Wow. They were delicious.

The nice lady on the phone was helpful, pleasant and when she found out this was our first visit told us they were happy to have us and looked forward to serving us. Its the little things that keep places like this going strong. When we were pulling in we noticed the sign outside saying they now have fried oyster nachos. Needless to say we walked in with a big grin and truly excited about our dining experience. We sat down and noticed the lack of people in the restaurant. This place was dead! Maybe everyone was in the club? Who knows but it threw us for a loop. We sat and sat, no waiter yet. We were growing irritated and impatient and thinking we had made the wrong choice for dinner. When our waiter came around the corner Margie was about to rip him a new one until he began speaking the most helpful, nice and truly appreciative words to us. We knew immediately he was here to do his job, and do it well. I wish I had gotten his name, to give him proper credit for his job well done. Out came the chips and salsa. I started to get a little worried, because the salsa looked plain and lacking awesomeness. While the salsa was nothing to write home about, it was right. How else do you put it, so to quote Steve Jobs, its just works. We started with the oyster nachos, not knowing what to expect from them. Let me say, awesome! Giant oysters, fried to perfection, on top of a butt-ton of guacamole, on top of a perfectly freshly fried flour tortilla. Wow. Whoever came up with this hit the nail on the head.. They didn't over do it, over think it, or over the top it. I had heard the ritas were their claim to fame. And I also read that I could buy them in a pitcher. The 3 of us (all professional drinkers mind you) had already decided on getting a pitcher of frozen ritas, just not which one. As soon as our server heard the word margarita he knew we wanted the blue. We didn't know we wanted the blue, but upon seeing his face light up, we knew that's what we needed. The pitcher yielded each of us 2 drinks, that left us buzzing off the vapor trails coming off our frozen libations. Get the blue margaritas. Apparently the pitchers are also half price on Sundays. Ill be back. We hadn't quite decided what to order and I was hunting for tamales or the usual uber combo plate to give myself the best sampling of what this place had to offer. Then our server told us the special, combo fajitas for 2, half off. We knew this meant we would all waddle out of the place and our entree would only cost us 12 bucks or so. We bit. The fajitas were solid. The rice and beans were great. The chicken was tender and moist with tons of flavor, and the beef was about the most flavorful beef fajita I have put in my mouth. A+For a pitcher of margaritas, a big oyster appetizer and fajitas that fed us all, we spent 60 bucks on the dot. Not too shabby I don't think, when you consider what we got. Stuffed and buzzed... go team. We did eff up, and forgot to keep our receipt, which would earn us free sopapillas on Sunday, to go with our half price margarita pitcher.

Boom! This mini-club is just insanity in the form no lighting, old disco music combined with Mariachi, and of course a drink they call Blue Margaritas.... I call this Crazy Juice. Back in the day, this place and it's Blue Crazy drinks were almost like a right of passage amongst certain social circles. And many of us Houstonians have learned many a good lesson after a night at this quaint, innocent looking little establishment. I bet these Blue Margaritas have been the cause of all sorts of milestone in people's lives: arrests, brawls, break-ups, break-downs, love, inpromptu proposals, conceptions, loss of memory and/or minds... and so much more. The Food and Drinks here are just an afterthought, people come here to get obliterated. Okay, maybe not intentionally - but it happens anyway. I've seen it too many times! Thanks to a birthday party of wild idea of a friend, we decided to return to the ""goold ole times"" and have some drink at El Patio... things haven't really changed. One drink, and my skin was on fire and red. I felt amazing!!! But thankfully age and wrong-doings have taught me that is not necessarily an invittation to drnk more. I cut myself off, and I'm proud. No law enforcement got involved. Maturity at its finest!The food: really is just your mediocre Tex Mex, actually better than Taco Bell, but sad that is what I'm using as the comparison. but yeah, it is better than Taco Bell (which is great even to some people!) but not as good as Molinas or El Tiempo, at least not to me. Chips, queso, salsa, nachos... all were eaten really more to absorb the alcohol that was flooding in. They did their job, nothing more nothing less. The Bill - holy smokes, those ltitle Crazy Blue Drinks are not cheap! One small one, which is less than 12 oz, was over $9... but I couldn't have handled more than that one anyway, so I guess you can see it as: $9 = one Blue Margarita or 5 shots of vodka... that's what I'm going with, and that's what it felt like.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,el-patio-restaurant-and-club-houston-2,el-patio-restaurant-and-clhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/el-patio-restaurant-and-club-houston-2?start=120,el-patio-restaurant-and-club-houston-2,Adam R.,"Houston, TX",38,135,11,,2/2/12,"Chips n salsa, blue margaritas, fajitas asados: Pretty goooood.

They said the portions have gotten somewhat smaller - but nowadays we don't need extra anyway. Some of the waiters have been there that long. (PROS) The food is consistently good and flavorful. I usually get their chicken enchilada plate, but many times try their skirt steak, or some beef fajita plate. I tried their breakfast Eggs Rancheros once and it was delicious. (Their food reminds me of ""Mi Terra"" in Sa Antonio); Excellent flour and corn tortillas. They have a great queso and you can add ground beef or chopped beef fajitas to it; My husband loves their famous blue margaritas (which, by the way, are made with Everclear or some similar strength liquor) - they are too strong for me - they don't use that tangy super sweet/tart mix that so many other places use, so that at first the regular Rita may taste a little dry - but after a few sips, life is good : ) If you have room, I highly recommend their sopapillas for dessert. They are excellent. Flaky, tasty, always fresh and still warm when brought to the table, they are dusted with powdered sugar and served with honey - very different from other Mexican restaurant's usually much heavier doughy kind. Wait staff attentive and professional (there's been a few times we've had waitstaff who seem to forget about us); but for the most part - good service; really good mariachis on their busiest days only - I notice they don't play overly loud which is very much appreciated.(CONS): their salsa is not that good; Friday/Saturday nights it is super busy and crowded. Many of the clientele who bring their children allow them to roam and play in the dining room (it must be after a couple of those blue margaritas!); for some odd reason, I've noticed its mainly professionals who do this; many times I've seen the children gravitate towards the mariachis who interact with them (which is not a CON at all), but at this point the noise in the restaurant gets very loud and it's hard to carry on a conversation. There are frequently large parties of guests (bachlorette parties, anniversary celebrations, etc.) with lots of children. On their non-busy nights, restaurant quiet and peaceful.Club No Minor - Even though it's a separate room from the main restaurant with a door dividing the two rooms, it can get much too loud and boisterous. And I do mean boisterous. Fortunately there is always an HPD officer by the door. I've been in the club on less busy nights and you get really good service, same great food and fantastic drinks. Low lighting and very old-fashioned sports-bar feel (think 1970's Starsky & Hutch era); Parking - the poor soul who started this place probably had no idea his restaurant would be such a winner - the parking is limited (on busy nights only); a lot of times they have valet parking, which to me is laughable, because......well, you'll see. This is no fault of the restaurant - they're simply in too small a place - a small strip center and also - they share the strip with an unassuming TAT shop and a dry cleaners. Many times, we've parked a block down and walked - their food IS that good.I highly recommend this restaurant - on non-busy nights.

We smelled the plates, table, menus, food, tortilla container, everything. We couldn't peg it as anything at the table, though. We noticed it would get worse when the AC was blowing, so it must be their vents or AC system...or just stale, dirty air (maybe they should air the place out). Next time we won't sit in there.
