We tried it for a late breakfast/early lunch on a Saturday, and the place was packed. There's really no hostess, but you wait near the front and grab a table when it opens.The food is classic diner food: eggs, pancakes, burgers, shakes, etc. I tried the french toast, and it was great--I especially liked that it was sprinkled in powdered sugar and cinnamon. It was nothing fancy at all--just sandwich bread cooked up, but I liked it. And, I have to admit, though it was early, my friend and I split an Oreo shake--while I wish there had been whipped cream on the top, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I came for lunch and ordered their lunch grilled chicken breast with pineapple and a side of sweet potato. There was nothing spectacular about this meal. The grilled chicken breast looked like it was flattened and marinated in a salty sauce. I should have asked how the breast was cooked but there was no mention in the description that there was sauce so I assumed it to be plain. The pineapple chunks are not fresh, it's pretty much from canned pineapple. The sweet potato is your standard 1/2 baked sweet potato. The only thing I surprisingly enjoyed was their cornbread. A tad dry but the flavor was good. Service was lacking. The side salad that came with my entree was a bit pathetic. It was served in a small soup bowl and the leaves were ice berg lettuce which is just nasty. As I've heard, I'd stick to avalon diner as a breakfast go to and not anything else.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,avalon-diner-houston,avalon-diner-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/avalon-diner-houston?start=20,David T.,"Houston, TX",0,5,,,6/5/17,"We were in area of Westheimer diner on Sunday morning and decided to give it a try.

Anyway, it was something very noticeable. I've been a few times and can vouch for the quality of the basics: the eggs, pancakes, hashbrowns, biscuits, etc. are great. But this time, like the previous time, I got ambitious and ordered the Super ""6"" omelette off the healthy portion of the menu. The omelette is a six egg white omelette with bell peppers, mushrooms, and other veggies inside. It was way too watery with veggies that did not taste very good. I found myself not eating the vegetables and focusing on the egg whites, which were drenched.The moral of the story is to stick to the basics at diners, and to not get too fancy.

It is just that good in terms of the old-timey diner feel, the sheer extent of the menu, and the quality of the dishes. There is no reason to ever go to an iHop, Waffle Haus, Denny's, or other 'prominent' chain if you are near Avalon. If you have not been to Avalon yet you have no idea what you are missing out on - but judging on the lines, and there are ALWAYS lines for a table, most people in Houston already know about this place. My biggest and sole complaint, which has claimed a star, is the amount of time spent waiting for a table - always. A place has to be that good that you will wait for the table, but you will be a bit miffed at how you are still there waiting rather than truckin' on elsewhere.It's in a strip mall so there is parking. Even as crowded as it gets inside waiting in line there is still parking, so that is good. It also seems clear that several people are walking over from the nearby townhouses so you have to feel alright that locals have continued to pour on in over the years, making this a gem of the neighborhood for many years. I had high hopes my first time here that it was going to be a Bob's Burgers kind of experience with zany misadventures and very family-run. It's not. And there weren't any. It is definitely River Oaks-ish with the vast majority of the clientele, they would drop a monocle at the sight of anything going even potentially sideways. So Avalon is a really, very controlled environment where everything is pretty perfect. The wait staff is not exceedingly talkative or friendly, but they are not rude, and they do as instructed in a timely manner. You can always tell where the rich white people of River Oaks go because the service falls in line. But that leads to less interesting experiences as I prefer the all-sorts-come type of experience where maybe the waitress shows tattoos and joins in on a spirited Harry Potter debate - that would never happen here.The challah french toast is the one plate that makes Avalon an institution. It is the go-to plate of many. It is soft, flavorful, delicious, and visually-stunning as it sits there on the plate. It basically says ""eat me"" but in the good way, like Alice in Wonderland, not in the sarcasti-sad teenager-shopping-at-Hot-Topic voice. There are plenty of other things on the menu but really, why go to a diner that has challah french toast (if you're not familiar with Jewish people this is THE jam as far as bread and bread-related-products go) and get **Mrs. Featherbottom voice** a banger in the mouth?The place is so busy it gets very, very loud so just be on notice. There are the tables, in classic northeast diner fashion, smushed together as closely as possible. Plus the booths of people. Plus the counter service. Plus the throngs of people waiting in line to get a table. Lots of voices, small place, it is loud. But it is worth it for that first and last bites into the challah french toast.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,avalon-diner-houston,avalon-diner-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/avalon-diner-houston?start=40,Mysc C.,"Houston, TX",248,175,18,Elite ’17,5/2/15,"YUM!

I told her I didn't like them and she asked me if I wanted a fruit bowl instead. The little bowl she brought to me was deceiving. I decided to dump all the fruit onto the little plate and it could barely contain all the fruit. The pineapple was canned but everything else was fresh. And....she didn't add the fruit bowl on to the ticket.

The big breakfast is a good deal. Table service but first come-first serve seating (a bit annoying considering there is no list or hostess and not efficient at all with 2 people at 4 tops and 3 people at 6 tops). My suggestion: share a big breakfast TO GO for a lazy and cost-friendly weekend morning with someone special. Food: The Big breakfast comes with a lot of options but I recommend the pancake for your bread option and sausage patty for your meat option. The Mexican eggs are also a good option and nicely spiced (comes with chorizo, tomato, onions and potatoes and side of salsa). One annoying point, coffee doesn't come with real milk... Service: I feel like if you are a regular (seems like a lot of regulars), you get good service, but to newcomers like us, our server was fairly brusque. Kept forgetting my toast even after requesting twice. I don't feel like having to build credibility for decent service. However, big shout-out to a wonderfully fun and jovial bus-man (I think it was his birthday!). Prompt service and he had a huge smile on his face. Ambiance: It's a no frills diner.

I have heard a lot of positive things about Avalon, mainly being an older establishment which has great burgers. Since they were recently named one of the top budget spots in River Oaks for lunch, I wanted to see if the article was true. I ordered a fairly fail-safe dish, the chicken fried steak and eggs which came on two separate plates with toast and hash browns. The meal looked great when it first came to the table so that was a good sign. The eggs were pretty standard, the wheat toast was supplemented with good quality strawberry and blackberry preserves on the table. The chicken fried steak was the only dish I was most worried about since I am picky when it comes to eating them. This CFS was hand-breaded according to the menu and the best part of it was probably the country gravy. The meat seemed like it wasn't the best quality or too fresh. The breading was crispy but just seemed like something was missing about it. Although I was able to eat my entire meal, it was filling but I probably wouldn't come back just to order this dish.I will have to make another trip back for the hand-spun milkshakes since they seem to be a popular item. I just didn't have enough room for one on this trip.My lunch mate ordered the Migas and they looked like a soupy mess when it arrived at the table. He was a little leery about ordering this dish from a non-mexican restaurant but he still cleaned his plate as well.

He was very attentive to me and all the other guests at the bar. I ordered the challah French toast with caramel, bananas and pecans.

Armed with the list of ""Best Burgers in Texas"" from Texas Monthly, as well as the similarly titled list put out by the Houston Chronicle, we felt well prepared.Our first choice, which will not be named here, was disappointingly closed on Sundays. It was from the Texas Monthly list. No matter! We chose Avalon out of the newspaper list as our backup plan and headed out...When we arrived at Avalon it was located in the middle of a strip shopping center. Not in any way attractive, but who cares if the burgers are that good, right? So we went on in. Hmmm. Yeah, kind of looks like a diner inside. Cheap, cheesy, kind of old.So, we waited for our table for a while, but after no one decided to seat us we finally just grabbed a table. Some time within a year after that, a waitress came over and took drink orders.As we waited on our drinks we toiled over the menu, trying to decide which burgers we should each order. Personally I opted for the sliders (mini burgers), while my friends went the more traditional route. So, let's just skip to the part where we have our food (which came like 30 minutes later, even though they were NOT busy): - The fries obviously came straight from a $.99 bag of frozen crinkle cuts. I could have done better at home. - My burgers were over-cooked. Despite that, the flavor was good. Not great, but good. I'd say they reminded me of burgers at Braum's. - One of the burgers we ordered came with onions, despite a no-onion request. To make it worse, while picking off the onions we found a hair inside. I don't care who you are, that is just wrong.The tables were littered with all manner of condiments, and each of them felt sticky and kind of gross. You just knew that avian flu might be hanging out all over those things.

Also, one time they slightly messed up my order by forgetting the sausage patties and accidentally gave me 2 extra strips of bacon instead. I told my server (the manager) and he immediately brought out my sausage patties...but the dude grabbed a napkin, reached over my shoulder, and took the two extra strips of bacon off of my plate!

I ordered the caramel, pecan, banana french toast and asked for the caramel on the side since it was overwhelmingly sweet the last time i ordered it. The ended up making it with the caramel on it anyway and the Waitress asked if that was ok or if we wanted it redone, so we politely explained that we preferred it on the side since it was too sweet and gooey. The waitress rudely yelled to the kitchen to remake it and since we were sitting at the booth closest to the kitchen I could hear the staff complaining in Spanish (I speak Spanish so I know what they were saying) that we asked for it to be done.

Their beloved Avalon Diner was packing up shop and moving across the street and down a few blocks. It was no longer going to be a drugstore eatery, but just simply a diner. The thing that helped put people's minds at ease? They were going to keep the same soda fountains and staff. Still no one was pleased. Their greasy spoon, their throw back to high school days was changing. I understood. I agreed. It was a fun place. Sticky floors and some of the best burgers in town. Also, how often do you still see a true pharmacy complete with eatery anymore. Rare indeed.I am glad to say that the contempt and general malaise died out when the new location opened. It still had that old diner feel to it. There is a great long counter. You can talk to the short order cooks if you're feeling brave and bold. There are many tables and booths, as well.

That also means if a large group comes in and they want to save tables for the rest of their buddies, you'll get to wait while the four people in front of you hold down four tables and don't even order while you wait for the fifth free table.

That's happened several times as well.I still function on the student budget , so I love coming here for the burgers and the crinkle fries.

I heard all the gossip and complaints from the waitresses talking to each other not trying to avoid being overheard. I heard how as one waitress put it "" that man is always in here and just orders coffee but he's eating today."" And how ""they"", the customers better tip still because it was a free meal and they can afford it. A father and his daughters (ages approx 11 and 13), who I got the impression are regulars came in and the older girl wanted a waffle and a bowl of cereal. The waitress told her that she can have the cereal after the waffle and only one small box at a time instead of two like the girl wanted. The girl looked at her dad and he told the waitress to give his daughter the two boxes of cereal and to put the order in for the waffle. I can't believe the gall the waitress had. It was totally rude.I ordered the 3-2-1 and for the most part it was good. However when I got to the fruit cup the honeydew had soured and it made me gag and very nauseous. I told the waitress and she didn't even offer a substitute. There should definitely be some sort of quality assurance.As I was checking out a man from Frost was at the check out counter and said he would like to buy my breakfast I graciously accepted, thanked him and told them I'll be right back I had to run out to my car to get cash to leave a tip.

There were many available tables and no wait, so I'm happy we got in late. It didn't bowl me over. I like the place, and it had its points, but I wouldn't try my hardest to get in when there's a line out the door. I had the chilaquiles (with the grilled chicken in it), which I got with hashbrowns and comes with sour cream and slices of avocado and 2 eggs. The eggs were cooked really well (over medium, no runny whites which I've experienced WAY too many times). The chicken had a kind of teriyaki taste to it but it worked with the chilaquiles. The odd thing was that the chicken was chopped really finely in some places and in HUGE chunks in others. Also, the chips that come with it weren't strips, they were actually whole tortilla chips with red salsa all over them. It wasn't bad and didn't change the taste, I just thought it was odd. It was also slightly cold, but only on the edges. I think they put together my dish as my boyfriend's was still cooking. Again, it didn't put me off of the place, but I did notice it.My b/f had the ""Ooze Burger"", which was right up his alley: a burger with a fried egg on top, mayo and cheese. As soon as he bit into it, the egg yolk exploded out of the bun, up his nose and into his beard and down his hands. It was awesome for entertainment, but if it had been me, I would've been a little more than annoyed. The fries were good (and we got a side of cream gravy for them, mmhmm), the egg cream was good and for both of us, it was less than $25.00. The reason I give this place 4 stars is because our waitress was awesome! I don't remember what her name was (I dunno if she even gave it to us), but she was an older Hispanic lady with very curly, short hair and she was so inviting and sweet and just made us feel good to be there. That's pretty rare in a waitress. I was also happy we got her and not the other blonde waitress who thought it was appropriate to yell loudly, ""Okay, who's the DUMBASS that did this wrong??"" in front of everyone and their mother.

With a proper soda fountain and lunch counter, vinyl upholstered stools and booths, Avalon Diner is an old-fashioned diner that keeps bellies full and faces smiling in the Upper Kirby district, and looks every bit ""justly famous since 1938.""I enjoy going to Avalon for breakfast, ordering up eggs, bacon, hash browns - the proper kind, golden brown shredded potatoes, not the crispy cubes that might as well come frozen from Sysco - and plenty of coffee. I like my eggs over-medium with just a bit of runny yolk but the whites cooked through, and at Avalon, the outside gets a nice golden hue from the seasoned griddle in back. And if that sounds delish, try the Grill Cook's Medley, which is just about everything including hash browns, onions, peppers, and ham, all tossed together and grilled up with the flavors of the bacon and everything else that cast iron has cooked, topped with cheese and two fried eggs.It's not just breakfast at Avalon though, with plenty of sandwiches, soups, chicken tenders, and delicious ""Drug Store Burgers."" There used to be an apothecary at the Diner judging by the old pictures on the walls, and there was a pharmacy attached by a side door up until recently, but that has since been replaced. Which is kinda sad really. Not only because of the nostalgia factor, but also because it was nice to pop next door for some Alka-Seltzer Morning Relief before you tucked into that crispy bacon and coffee on those bleary-eyed mornings. In any event, the burgers are delicious, especially the ""Ooze Burger,"" which is topped with a fried egg for good measure.The Avalon Diner has been around quite awhile, which means it can get pretty crowded on weekends with neighborhood (River Oaks) families that have been coming there for years, and especially so after a Mass exodus from St. Anne's just up the road on Sundays. If you don't get there early, i.e. before 10, you may have to wait in line to seat yourself. And while the staff on these hectic mornings can get a little brusque, if you can endure these minor setbacks, you'll be justly rewarded.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,avalon-diner-houston,avalon-diner-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/avalon-diner-houston?start=120,Warren P.,"Austin, TX",56,33,1,,10/31/10,"Your classic diner with staff that have been there longer then you've been alive.I'm from the South, and instantly felt right at home here.

Who knows what it was, my experience at Avalon Diner was definitely one I would not like to experience again. My boyfriend and I got there around 2 or so and saw about 3 tables that were occupied as well as some people sitting at the counter. We walked in and the lady at the cash register told us to sit anywhere we would like. So we sat down and that's about it for the next 5-7 minutes. We sat and waited and kept looking around for signs that said ""order at the counter,"" or something of the sort that would let us know if there was waiter service or not. Finally one of the ladies who was sitting at the counter area came around to us and gave us a couple of menus. She seemed to be in the middle of eating her lunch because she still had food stuck to her lips and when she spoke to us, pieces of food came flying towards us and the table. I was hungry but I would like my own food rather than someone else's predigested food...totally made me want to get up and leave. We placed our order: fried pickles, chili dog, and a patty melt. Our food seemed to arrive faster than how long it took to get our orders taken. The pickles were OK, nothing extraordinary about the batter. The one good thing was that the batter stuck to the pickles and didn't fall off when you took a bite of the pickle. The chili dog and patty melt came out and first impression was simply, this is our food? The chili dog was covered with lukewarm chili that you couldn't see the hot dog or the bun. It didn't look very appetizing. Unfortunately, the flavor of the hot dog. The patty melt was simple and greasy but you couldn't taste the flavor of the meat, onions, cheese or rye bread. I simply just tasted grease. There are days when I crave those frozen fries but today was not the day and that is exactly what I got, crinkle cut fries that were a bit overcooked. Our waitress filled our drinks a little too much and it overflowed onto the table. She cleaned it up quickly, but used the same towels used to clean all the tables and seats and left some food scraps as she wiped up the water.

I consider it to have something of the ""premiere"" diner food of all diner food in Houston - breakfast, burgers, shakes. Artery clogging, yes, but extremely satisfying all the same.The entrance can get mobbed, particularly on Sunday morning after the church services start getting out, but when my friends and I wake up and crave Avalon, a little bit of a wait isn't enough to stop us.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,avalon-diner-houston,avalon-diner-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/avalon-diner-houston?start=120,Janelle B.,"Houston, TX",22,29,26,,2/18/08,"Come here when you want to escape the chain restaurants for somewhere unique and local. This place doesn't look like much, just a storefront wedged in between the others, but it's got a menu full of good, solid meals.I was impressed by their efficiency. I came on a Sunday morning when the place was just packed. In spite of the crowds we were barely kept waiting; they got us seated and served quickly. And despite the rush, our server was attentive and came to check on us frequently.Besides, the fact that it gets so packed, that alone shows you they must be doing something right. Their customers clearly keep coming back for more.It's a diner, and you will be served diner food. But it's GOOD diner food. I can only comment on the breakfast, but I was very satisfied. It's a bit crowded, and the tables kind of spill into the waiting area. Like I said, it's a diner. This is a great stop after you've been out with friends, you're hungry, and you just want a good satisfying meal without the fanfare.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,avalon-diner-houston,avalon-diner-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/avalon-diner-houston?start=140,Pablo R.,"Houston, TX",0,16,,,5/24/10,"We went there this weekend after going there a few weeks ago and it's the last time we'll be there. The food is greasy and mediocre at best. The service was horrible. My wife ordered the banana pancakes and after taking a few bites noticed that the middle was undercooked. So she sent them back and after 10 minutes got another batch - again, undercooked. All this after moving from one booth to another booth when the air conditioning vent started leaking water on her head. When we asked to change booths, the waitress seemed upset, but got us another booth while another waitress came out with a swiffer broom that looked so dirty that it had probably been used to sweep the floors for the past 5 years and started wiping the condensation from the overhead a/c vent. Needless to say, I'm sure some dirt fell from the broom all around the booth into other people's food.","alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,avalon-diner-houston,avalon-diner-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/avalon-diner-houston?start=140,Sam B.,"Philadelphia, PA",70,431,108,,4/21/13,"little strip mll type place that is easy to miss or easy to happen upon depending on what you are attempting to do (find it or find something else, which is how I discovered it) Menu was good, portions were nice and the service was great.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,avalon-diner-houston,avalon-diner-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/avalon-diner-houston?start=140,Gilberto V.,"Houston, TX",116,123,113,,4/18/08,"Price is right, selection is optimal, and I knocked a star for Sunday mornings, though it appears Leslie addressed that in her review. I cannot tell a lie, part of the first star was knocked because of french fry inconsistency - but don't let that stop you. If you like diner food, hit up the Avalon Diner on Westheimer, so conveniently tucked away that you may just pass it up. The shakes are delicious, the burgers are juicy, and the overall ambience screams ""time to eat"" - casual, fun and an experience to behold.When what you want is more than just a trip to a burger joint, but less than the full pomp and circumstance of the full meal outing, then Avalon Diner is the ideal choice. This ain't some silly suburban outer loop chain restaurant that tries to act like it's not a chain - this is the real deal. Local, fun, and enjoyable - the food is delicious, and vegetarians can delight in a salad while the rest of us omnivores devour the wide array of meatgoodness available at the Avalon Diner.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,avalon-diner-houston,avalon-diner-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/avalon-diner-houston?start=140,Michael H.,"Houston, TX",279,140,10,,4/13/11,Old women have been there too long so service is stale and RO crowd is too.

I ordered the ""western omelette,"" a renamed Denver omelette, which supposedly came with ham, green peppers, onions and *cheddar* cheese, with hashbrowns and a biscuit. My companion got the chicken fried steak and eggs with grits and a biscuit. I can't speak to his as I didn't try it, but I can say it looked edible. Mine was abysmal. The hashbrowns were soggy with a bit of crisp on the outside and were not seasoned at all, even ketchup couldn't save them. The omelette was thin dry eggs with a melange of burnt ham, green pepper and onion, slathered in *american* cheese. That, and it was close to $9.00. The booth was dirty, the bottles of hot sauce and ketchup looked like an army of two year olds had slimed them, opened them, dipped them in their contents and left them to marinate. I understand that it's a diner and my companion thought I was being overly critical, but just because it's a diner doesn't mean it has to be unsanitary. I like clean, and if I would not ask my mother to set foot in a place, I don't think I can justify eating, or in this case not eating, there again. I didn't finish my omelette and I won't be going back.","alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,avalon-diner-houston,avalon-diner-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/avalon-diner-houston?start=140,Leigh M.,"Austin, TX",69,324,3,,9/22/06,"Around since 1938, this old school diner in River Oaks serves the best lemonade ever -- fresh-squeezed juice and homemade simple syrup blended with shaved ice.

We kept hearing how great of a breakfast spot this is and we were highly disappointed. The waiting line was out the door but did move fairly quick. Once we sat down at our table we waited 17min before we were even acknowledged. 20 min sitting we finally got water slopped down on our table but our waitress literally ran off before we could even ask for coffee or tea. We had to ask the guy cleaning off tables to help us place our order. He said he'd be right back and go get a waitress. 5 min later he came back to make sure we had been helped. We had not been helped yet. Normally I would have walked out not even getting tea of coffee 25 min into actually being seated already. FINALLY 30 min later our waitress came to take our order and apologized with no reason everyone around us were already eating that came in after us. We were at least hoping the food would make up for the worst service. Nope - IHOP is better than this place. I had the Migas, my boyfriend had 3 eggs plate and our friend had an omelet. Food wasn't bad, but it def isn't worth the wait or poor service. Denny's and IHOP have better food than this place. When you leave you have to stand in line again to pay on your way out. This was another 10min wait. Apparently the person behind the register doesn't know what they're doing. We finally just put enough cash with our receipt on the counter and walked out. Needless to say, we will never go back. Save yourself the misery and just go somewhere with good service and a reputation.","alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,avalon-diner-houston,avalon-diner-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/avalon-diner-houston?start=140,Laura M.,"Chicago, IL",13,21,,,7/23/10,"Purely sentimental review, but awesome burgers and fountain sodas :)","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,avalon-diner-houston,avalon-diner-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/avalon-diner-houston?start=140,Sean C.,"Richmond, VA",54,276,378,,3/22/09,"Any place that serves my favorite Crinkle Cut fries almost automatically gets three stars.
