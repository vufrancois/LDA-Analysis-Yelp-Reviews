It is so fresh and has a good spice that is not overpowered by tomatoes. This restaurant is in a sketchy neighborhood, but the streets are lined with Mercedes, Lexus, and BMW's as the yuppies have flocked here to get some good Tex-Mex grub. The Tacos Al Carbon were good, not great, but the tortillas and salsa were so fresh it made the dish satisfying.The margaritas are seriously strong. They are good, but you can feel them as they go down. The mild burning sensation eventually turns into a good buzz. More than two or three glasses are not recommended by me.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,spanish-village-restaurant-houston,spanish-village-restauranthttps://www.yelp.com/biz/spanish-village-restaurant-houston?start=80,Andrew M.,"Houston, TX",8,181,,,7/14/07,"I definitely liked the atmosphere at Spanish Village, I would definitely consider it a dive. However, it had a fun atmosphere to just kick back and enjoy a margarita. I really enjoyed by enchilada's and the salsa was pretty good with a nice little kick. My margarita was good, but WAY overpriced. Overall, for what we ordered I kind of felt ripped off.

I had a combo plate with a taco (basically ground beef with tomatoes and lettuce), which I found pretty bland. The seasoning of the beef wasn't particularly exciting, and I specifically asked for a soft taco but I got a hard taco instead (not my favorite). I also got a sort of round taco shell with refried beans and lettuce and tomatoes on it (I could have made that at home pretty easily), and another taco shell with some queso on it (I would have rather had queso for dipping the tortilla chips into which tasted fresher than the taco shells).Then on the other plate was an enchilada which was good but nothing out of the ordinary, some rice which I can't complain about, and a tamale smothered in cheese. None of it was bad, just not exciting.And there was also a chili relleno which was unlike the other chili rellenos I had eaten before. It was lukewarm, smothered in a sticky red sauce, and it had raisins in it. I'm not a big fan of raisins. Maybe that's the traditional way of making it, but I wasn't a huge fan.The salsa was good, but again I didn't find it out of the ordinary. My favorite salsa is Chuy's salsa. In summary, it wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special, and I couldn't really recommend it.The most interesting thing about it was the fact that it has been around since the 50s and it seems to have a lot of history.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,spanish-village-restaurant-houston,spanish-village-restauranthttps://www.yelp.com/biz/spanish-village-restaurant-houston?start=80,Dan C.,"Houston, TX",363,60,11,,8/21/08,"This place has been around houston for ever, and I guess it must be here out of people's habits.

Even though food and service were good, I wasn't sure whether the staff was giving us star treatment just because my colleague in my party has been a regular of theirs for the past 10+ years.Determined to come back, I brought my hubby to Spanish Village for another weekday lunch a few weeks later. And to my surprise, the food and service were just as good. This place definitely doesn't have the best Mexican food in town, but you can tell it's authentic and not as greasy as your typical tex-mex joints. On top of their margaritas (I swear you can get blitzed with just two or three - it's like flakes of margarita ice!), I highly recommend the Chile con Queso (with a side of jalapenos), Pork Carnitas (nice and crispy), and their Fajitas al Carbon. To top off the meal, they always serve a few Mexican sweets with your bill (a nice touch, if you ask me!). While I'm sad they don't stay open late (since this would definitely be a great place to either keep your buzz going with 'ritas or fight your hangover with heavy food), I'm happy that Spanish Village keeps their family traditions and warm hospitality alive.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,spanish-village-restaurant-houston,spanish-village-restauranthttps://www.yelp.com/biz/spanish-village-restaurant-houston?start=60,stacey s.,"Houston, TX",5,38,,,5/7/12,"I really hate to rate Spanish Village this low.

Apples and oranges! The closest comparison is Spanish Flowers in terms of food, ambiance, and authenticity. Chuy's isn't exactly the most authentic, and it is also not traditional Mexican food--it is Tex Mex. So if you are looking for Tex Mex, go to Chuy's. That said, Spanish Village was a fun adventure. My hubby and I saw it listed in a food critic's top 100 spots in Houston and thought it would be fun to check it out. The margarita was divine--not too sweet, not too limey--and pretty strong. My only complaint was that they were served in a small martini glass, which was kind of an odd presentation. The chips had a sort of unpleasant undertaste, like they were fried in recycled lard or something. Salsa was pretty good. I appreciated that they made the effort to include a vegetarian plate. I think it tasted better than Spanish Flower's vegetarian plate, honestly. Yummy guacamole and cheese enchiladas. Vegetarian enchilada sauce was tasty too and was not suspiciously ""beefy"" like the one at SF. Make no mistake though, this is not Mexican gastronomy at its finest. This is ""grub""--greasy, gooey, and cheap ingredients. The service was attentive and friendly. My only issue was the price. I felt that our check was very high--we could have gone to an upscale Mexican place that does not serve ""grub"" and had an appetizer and margaritas with our entrees for the same price. I felt a little sticker shock. I think if the check was about half of what it was, I would have felt the price point matched a little better. But that was quickly remedied with fresh praline candy, still warm from the kitchen, brought out to us on a plate as we paid our check.

We let all our friends know if they wanted to go to dinner with us on Friday night, this is where we would be. It is still on a heavy rotation for Friday nights, sometimes just the two of us and sometimes with a group.. If your group is over 4, I strongly suggest calling for a reservation. We never have to wait for a table, even on a Friday night, but we always call ahead if we have a group.Their tables are cemented to the ground, but they have temporary tables and extenders for larger groups, and they need to figure this out ahead of time, so they appreciate the heads up.  They are a family run business, and a lot of the customers have been coming for a long time, so they may seem a little set in their ways, but they will warm up to you given the chance. One way this may be exhibited is their ""no drinks without food"" policy. If they don't know you and you just start ordering rounds of drinks before food, they'll let you know that they're not a bar, they're a restaurant! But once they know you, they know you know and they ease up and let you enjoy your pre-dinner cocktails in peace.So the food, it's good, actually above average, but I must say, really solid. My favorite thing there is the crispy beef tacos. And I don't even normally care for crispy beef tacos, but something about their ground beef is very yumsters. It's also in the burrito, and beef enchiladas, and that brings up the sauce--the enchilada sauce is devine. I always ask for extra sauce... And a side of sour cream, which they give you a small bowl full of sour cream. My husband likes the fried chicken. Order it asap because it takes a little longer to prepare. He says it is the best in town--better than Barbecue Inn. And he gets it with rice and beans instead of baked potato, but that looks good too. I've seen some tables order fried chicken for an appetizer or to share amongst themselves (4 pieces, 1/2 chicken), so that's a good idea if you want to try more than one thing. Also Carnitas are excellent, crispy and tender, guacamole is fresh and simple, and queso is standard good. The Deluxe Dinner is a good one because it comes with a crispy beef taco, CCQ tostada, guacamole salad to start, then a cheese enchilada, tamale, rice and beans. I tried the chile relleno once and didn't care for it. It was strange, like with raisins, but I think this is just an authentic old school way to make them and somebody out there likes it. I don't like the Spanish or Creole sauce either, it's just tomato-ey and bland, but if you like bland food you may like it.I love the margaritas, used to be addicted to the frozen, which they serve in a martini glass, no straw. And there's no margarita machine. They freeze jugs full of margarita and then squish and bang it out, so you get a kind of crunchy slushy that you can sip or gulp. But now I order the rocks, which is the exact same formula as the frozen, served over ice in a larger glass, so the amount of actual margarita is the same, unlike some other restaurants that give you the same pre-mixed recipe as the frozen and pour it over ice in the same glass, so you get half as much when you order rocks.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,spanish-village-restaurant-houston,spanish-village-restauranthttps://www.yelp.com/biz/spanish-village-restaurant-houston?start=80,Peter B.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,,10/12/12,Just get the Regular or the Deluxe.

As far myself, I had some kind of ckn enchiladas with a bright red sauce that is still burning my stomach as I type. The only good thing I can say about this place is that the service was good.

Spanish Village is real Tex-Mex. A real Tex-Mex place has lots of lard, chili comes on everything, and their burger and fries is up there with the best in town.If a place specializes in Fajitas, and it costs more than $15 a head to eat there, it is not Tex-Mex. Chuy's is not real Tex-Mex. Lupe Tortilla's is not real Tex-Mex. These places serve overpriced faux Tex-Mex geared towards suburban lames.This place is a treasure; a real time capsule. It's in the neighborhood that I call ""Black Montrose"" and I'm guessing it was there well pre-White Flight. The food has not changed since the 60's too, I'm willing to bet.The service here is second to none. I've talked to the owner a few times, and he said some of the people opening trendy ""revisionist"" Tex-Mex restaurants have offered to buy his recipes. I believe it. This is the Real McCoy and a dying breed. May they live on for decades, and not compromise as their neighborhood gentrifies.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,spanish-village-restaurant-houston,spanish-village-restauranthttps://www.yelp.com/biz/spanish-village-restaurant-houston?start=60,Mark W.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,,4/16/13,"Extremely DISAPPOINTED. This is my FIRST and ONLY time to write a REVIEW on yelp. Therefore, I felt my experience was worth sharing to take the time to write and here's why:I have always recommended eating here with friends and family, not necessarily for the food, but for the casual atmosphere and potent margaritas. In fact, we celebrated my mom's 60th here.That being said, I WILL NOT BE RETURNING. The last three times I have been there, the experience has been increasingly worse each time. Not to mention, the patrons as a whole have lessened each time I have returned with a few friends.Recently, each time I've been there the waitstaff reluctantly takes down a margarita order, only to notify management - so they can watch you like a hawk. John, the Owner claims, ""We keep an eye on everyone."" Which, in doing so, does not make for a casual atmosphere. John has become extremely anal about alcohol consumption - even to the point that you must order an entree if you plan to drink a margarita. No splitting food orders.In fact, just this past weekend, John pulls me aside after I began sitting at the table with a group of friends and BEFORE ORDERING ANYTHING, he asks if we'd been drinking. I was honest with him - sure, we had been drinking, it was the weekend. Were we drunk? Not in the slightest. Needless to say, this accusation and unnecessary confrontation made us feel so uneasy and unwelcome that we simply told John how we felt and left. For good.I don't know if this establishment and their owners have come into a conflict with some legal issues recently or what, but the relaxed atmosphere has been completely sabotaged - which has now become very evident. Management could use a lesson on customer service.

I got the chicken flautas meal which was $13.00. the same price as the flautas at escalantes - which is considered upscale Mexican. the chicken was so dry and over cooked it was inedible. luckily there was a pound of bland guacamole on top of them so I had something to eat. the rice and beans were so salty I could not eat them. the food was garnished with raw onion and carrot slices which I found odd. all of the food that came to our table looked totally unappetizing.I understand that we had a very large party but only half of us got our food and then the rest of us waited for a very long time before receiving their orders. the service was so poor. I never heard any of them ask if we needed anything even though it was obvious that with the size of our party we would be spending a good bit of money and time with them tonight. we had to ask for chip, water and soda refills throughout our meal, flagging servers down from across the room.the appearance of the building was awful with half of the name of the restaurant having fallen off of their street sign and the decor was tacky - and not in a good way. the bathrooms were disgusting. you could tell that this place has cut every corner possible to just barely stay in business, in addition to charging outrageous prices for small portions of ill prepared cheap products.I signed up for yelp just so I could post this review because I feel so completely unsatisfied with my family having paid for this meal. the experience was horrible and I cannot believe that the owner would allow such garbage to come out of this kitchen.

The Margaritas (in my opinion) are the best in Houston; the best I have had anywhere in the world. Prepare yourself: they are sour. Just lime juice, tequila, and a little bit of triple sec. So they are very sour. But instead of being blended, they have been frozen for many days in their freezer. They have these sour, limey, platelet-like crystals of Margarita; like nothing else I have had anywhere in the world. Once you have had these Margaritas you will not want anything else. Everything else is an impostor after this. This is also true of their re-fried beans, cheese enchiladas, and other tex-mex food. The Family is also fantastic. I feel the love every-time I go.

It rare that an almost Clear Lake family like mines would even get out into Houston to dine at a Midtown restaurant.but what the heck, drink orders of 2 margaritas, specified a water with 3 lemons, and a lemonade with no ice. When our drinks came: my water had no lemons. I later read on the menu that it would be an extra charge for lemons in water. OK fine. My dad and sister weren't a fan of the margaritas as they said, ""it wasn't enough alcohol and funny tasting."" So, our waitress brought out stronger margarita for my dad since she couldn't believe that my dad didn't like it. Then, food orders: I got the vegetarian dinner to be on the safe side of avoiding meals with meat and confusion with ordering. My dad got the beef fajita plate, and my friend got the chalupa plate. The first meal that arrived at the table were the sides for my vegetarian plate - what looked like a mess on a plate. The presentation wasn't there. A taco bowl upside down drenched in processed nacho cheese with a guacamole taco swimming in the cheese and tomatoes/lettuce. The food looked bad and wasn't worth the price of $16. The cheese got cold quick and the guac taco was ice cold too. The guac didn't taste fresh, it tasted more like 4 days old. The other side plate of guac, limes, and a salad was a waste as I didn't have anything to put it on. I was extremely disappointed at this point. I wished my group got up and left because it was bad! But instead, we stayed and endured more horrific food and presentations. Then, everyone's food arrived. I couldn't even fully mask what my meal was because the presentation of the food was so sloppy. My vegetarian dinner lacked a lot of flavors - it was very bland. Again, there was an abundance of melted cheese in my meal that wasn't necessary, but an annoyance to deal with while attempting to eat. No tofu, no vegetables stuffed enchiladas, or quesadillas, nothing but enchiladas wrapped within itself covered in brown sauce and cheese. The Spanish rice was the only thing that was good and authentic tasting. The food arrived on a very hot plate, but why did the food get cold quick? My dad said that was the worst fajitas that he ever had - he didn't even finish his meal. I couldn't even finish the meal, no spices or anything. Everyone at the table was dissatisfied with their meals - it was nasty. Even the chips and salsa was bad. The chips were brought out in a plastic basket without a lining, they were bland, no salt to taste, and got cold quick. The salsa was soupy watered down, not chunky. The atmosphere of the restaurant was a mix between a family room with Polaroid pictures everywhere posted on the walls, Mexican fare, and Christmas lights everywhere. They need to really make their minds up. Our waitress was nice and attentive but strange. My sister would ask her a question about getting another alcoholic beverage, but our waitress would only always discuss it with my dad. My sister is an adult - also she told my friend that there weren't any refills on lemonade after he ordered it. She never brought out my lemon for my water. She only seemed very interested in talking to my dad about what we needed. Very strange.Now it was time to pay, and was the bill a nightmare, yes it was! $93 for a crappy meal - not worth it! Our waitress charged us for a margarita that she wanted my dad to get, so that should have been taken off the bill and out of her paycheck. The prices are outrageously expensive for the quality of the food. This experience reminded me of an episode of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares because it truly was a nightmare dining experience attempting to eat this disgusting food. Papagayos is so much better than this restaurant. Oh, and the complimentary Mexican pralines were good. My friend said that was the only thing good about this restaurant. No muy bien!","alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,spanish-village-restaurant-houston,spanish-village-restauranthttps://www.yelp.com/biz/spanish-village-restaurant-houston?start=0,Gail W.,"Lubbock, TX",97,200,1644,Elite ’17,6/13/17,"Reasons to come here: 1.

Come here if you're looking to spend money on not so great food. This place is CRAP! Literally the bottom of the chum bucket if plankton owned a Mexican restaurant this would be it. It is the worst of the worst that I've eaten at. The waitress will insult you and treat you like a child. Because having ""good"" genes doesn't exist to her. So, even though I'm legally 24 years old she still persisted to ask my father permission whether I can have alcoholic beverages. This went on for awhile. Where I kept asking our waitress for an alcoholic beverage and she referred to my father. Even though, she ID me and accepted it. That's not only insulting, but irritating too! The waitress even had the nerve to question my father whether if he is an alcoholic or not because he said his margarita wasn't strong enough. She continues to tell us that the frozen margaritas are left in the freezer for months for preparation. Months?! After hearing that I didn't want one. My father didn't even ask for a frozen margarita instead he asked for 2 coronas and the waitress still brought it out. Because she wanted him to try it, it was out of her will, but we was still billed for it. The food was a horrendous mess that shouldn't even have left the kitchen. From the menu the regular dinner sounded great, but the presentation was far from making it. A flipped upside down tortilla bowl with nacho cheese drenched on top and a pool of it all on the plate with a taco shell non seasoned ground beef which appeared similarities to Taco Bell taco flooding in it all. I had to ask myself where am I at Taco Bell or at an expensive restaurant that supposedly been in business for some years now? It was terrible, that my father was invited here by his customer Justin and for his customer to lie and say this is the best Mexican restaurant in Midtown. Yeah right, he must be delirious so must his co-workers and manager too! What topped it off was that our ignorant waitress brought out praline candy topped with an old strawberry for what a terrible meal we encountered?!?! What's the point of bringing out meals separately when it's apart of entire meal? So, while 2 people at our table wait patiently for their food the other 2 sit at the table and enjoy their first course meal. What's the point?! If you come here don't stay for awhile leave immediately there is nothing here to patronize just another restaurant that's struggling to make payments and to serve fresh food.","alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,spanish-village-restaurant-houston,spanish-village-restauranthttps://www.yelp.com/biz/spanish-village-restaurant-houston?start=0,Margaret M.,"Houston, TX",0,64,19,,8/22/17,"This restaurant is only blocks away from our home and we've enjoyed many meals there.
