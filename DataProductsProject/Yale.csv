I want to state that this is a review of only breakfast. I have only been here early in the morning and ordered only from the breakfast menu. If you're looking for a diner style breakfast, this is the spot for you. It's cheap, fast, made to order, and CHEAP! I swear, the first time I got my bill I double checked to make sure they had included everything. I'm a savory breakfast girl, but my friends ordered waffles and other sweet things and everyone at our table was more than satisfied. The portions were great, service is about what you'd expect from a diner, and we were in and out of there in no time. If you're looking for a fancy brunch with pitchers of mimosas, try Downhouse down the street.

It definitely has that small town diner feel with some good food to boot. Seating is plentiful with their counter seats, booths and tables and you can tell they have a lot of regulars. Since I'm a lover of a good breakfast, I opted for their ""big breakfast"" ( the name could be wrong lol) but it's a plate of eggs, your choice of ham or bacon, hash browns and 2 pancakes of your liking. I opted for 1 blueberry and 1 banana nut. The bf had their ""chicken and waffles.""I have to say that I was disappointed that the ""chicken"" wasn't actually pieces of fried chicken. They turned out to be friend chicken tenders but the bf loved it, so who am I to complain? When our food came to the table, everything was hot and fresh. Now, the highlight of my meal were my tasty pancakes!!! You can actually taste the fresh blueberry in the blueberry pancake and you get little bits of pecan in the banana nut pancake, yaaass!!! During our visit, we didn't get to visit their store part of the establishment but I know we'll be back to peruse the shelves.

One of the city's last authentic old ""Soda Fountains"" with delish vanilla or chocolate sodas or malts, decent coffee, bargain old fashioned breakfast with chicken fried steak & gravy, or TexMex brunch dishes. My favorite is an old fashioned Grilled Cheese sandwich, fried onion rings (served with extra thick batter!) along with a chocolate soda. If you have never tried an old fashioned chocolate soda, this is your unique opportunity. It is vanilla ice cream, soda water for a little fizz, chocolate syrup, with whipped cream and a cherry on top. What makes it even more special is they serve it in an authentic tall antique soda glass, making a special photo opp, sitting with your chocolate soda on the swivel red seats at the counter, just like the 1940s or 1950s. (Never get it to go in a plastic cup!!).  You can also enjoy the antique shop in the other part of the Grill afterwards, adding to the old timey feel. Bring your baby boomer relatives or friends here; they'll love it! I remember classmates coming over here after school from Hamilton Jr High in the1960s!! That antique school is worth a look also, right behind the Grill. After brunch, visit Jubilee"", my fave unique boutique around the corner on 18th street, with some great resale shops nearby, so make a day of it!  This place is not pristine gleaming Disney version of a 1950s diner: it is the real deal. Don't expect a spotless grill, McDonalds fast service, or order soup or salad here. Pick what's recommended and enjoy one of the last tastes of authentic nostalgia while its here, usually only open for breakfast and lunch.

Their burgers used to be raw hamburger meat cooked on a flat grill right in front of you, but no more. I was served some precooked mystery meat that I think was warmed up in a microwave in a secluded cooking area on a bun with a couple of strips of bacon. And the bacon was SPOILED!!!!!! Was SO gross.

You know when you walk into an old person's house and there's that smell? You know the one I'm talking about ... the mixture of mothballs and dust. Well that's the first thing I noticed. Could be because there's an antique shop in the same building, I mean same room (just separated by a half wall really). Everything was aged in the dining area too. I'm sure this is the look they are going for, but I just felt like everything was actually really old (and probably really dirty). They were really busy and I took a bit for our waitress to come say ""hi"" and take our orders. The coffee certainly hit the spot and had a great flavor. I had the mushroom and cheese omelet and all I can say is booooring. I cook with mushrooms and cheese often as a vegetarian, but these must have been the cheapest, most flavor lacking fungi ever! And the cheese was just a bad. They served the shredded hash browns I love, but they too were also dreary and squashy. Everything lacked any hint of spices. I was just so under impressed with it all. My man and the kids said there food was OK, but no one was raving about the place.

The shop is an antique shop where you can find books, toys, and other last minute Christmas gifts if you're shopping here this Christmas week. To find this restaurant was a chance to get to try another breakfast joint in Houston.I had some coffee and water and coffee is always good with breakfast, especially this brand they made. Then I ordered the chicken fried steak with over-medium eggs, hash browns, and English muffin. The steak was cooked just right with white gravy, and the eggs were perfect and not too runny. The English muffin was exactly what you'd expect it to be, and I tried it with a little grape jelly they provide on the table. The hash browns weren't too crispy, and not too soft. I give the breakfast a kudos because they know what breakfast is! I really enjoyed that.The shop I explored for a little bit and they have nice antiques and knickknacks to buy or just browse. Books, dolls, and other sentimental things are located in this hidden gift shop and I urge people to go look for a few minutes if you eat here and want to explore more. I did that and I knew if I left I would miss out on all this cool stuff to buy and to look at.This shop/restaurant is located within the Heights, where I used to live, and is a really nice place if you want to stop by for a quick bite of breakfast or to buy some things for people or for yourself. I've always wondered what that place looked like inside whenever I passed by it.

The place had a good stream of people coming in, most 4 to a table and others sitting at the counter.Now for the food. They serve Community Coffee and it was really good coffee! Some places you go to the coffee is bitter and not very tasty but this coffee was the best. My husband had the special which was the spinach omelet and I had the veggie omelet and both came with hash browns and we had the wheat toast. I know some have said that their omelets were rubbery and the hash browns tasteless, but I have to say our omelets were really good! The omelets came with salsa on the side which we put on our omelets and the omelets were even better. The salsa looked and tasted fresh made, it had the seeds from the peppers and other spices in it. It was really good. The hash browns were just right, not too crispy and not too soft and had a good flavor. Our breakfast wasn't anything fancy, special or over the top, just your typical omelet breakfast, but I can say it was good.Once we sat down at a booth, we were given water and asked if we wanted coffee, etc. Service was good and prompt and the food came out hot.

We often stop in after church on Sundays to take advantage of their breakfast specials. The waitresses are friendly, efficient and very accommodating with special requests and changes. The food is good and priced fairly well.The breakfast chicken fried steak and eggs is a favorite, with the steak being so tender that you can cut it with a fork. It doesn't have the crunchy texture that most are familiar with, but more of a shake-n-bake type crust. The eggs are usually cooked very well and we have only had a few occasions where they have come out cold. The pancakes and waffles are excellent and everyone seems to enjoy them. You might want to skip the grits, as they usually don't soak them long enough and they still have a bit of a bite, but the hashbrowns are a great alternative. The coffee is good and hot and the waitresses are quick with the refills.The only downside is the parking is a little awkward and there can be a slight wait on Sundays with the church crowds, but this is usually expected.

My mother, father, daughter, and husband had breakfast, which was cold, horrible tasting, served with bad service. My husband had to send back his meal because they literally put his hash browns on a plate and didn't even cook them. I am assuming they took them out of a box. The eggs were to be sunny side up and they were so undercooked and greasy, they had to be sent back as well. With the pancake and waffle breakfast you expect syrup, but nope that didn't come until about 5 minutes after our cold food was served. I on the other hand felt like lunch so I got the fried steak sandwich, the gravy was good, but the sandwich was gross. They put mayonnaise on a sandwich that had gravy, plus a ton of pickles. I love pickles, but on this sandwich and as much as they did, was really gross. The onion rings were also gross, out of the box and soggy. Then there was the service, which was terrible. I think there was 2 people's serving about 25 tables, they may have been good servers, but with that many customers they were doomed to fail. They also served cold and burnt coffee, which was replaced with just as bad coffee. Then at the end of this very underwhelming meal we had to wait 10 minutes just to get a check that was way overpriced.

They brew their coffee perfectly and I like the sweet undertones of the brew, further enhanced by some half and half. They also have great and friendly service. I loved that because it really enhanced the old time diner feel of the place. The food, though, was average. My over medium eggs were okay; the bacon that went with it, not so much. It tasted burnt and raw all at the same time. Is that even possible? I dont know.For the first time ever -- I did not eat all of the bacon served to me in a breakfast plate.

Two words, COESTER SAMMICH!!!

It will cure whatever ail's you. Here's how you do it (don't mind the look on the waitstaff's face when you blow their mind):1. Two buttered buns toasted to perfection2. Big delicious piece of chicken fried steak3. 2 fried eggs over-easy (preferably in bacon fat)4. Smother that shit with sausage gravy (like biscuits and gravy gravy) and ask for extra in a bowl fo the occassional ridiculous dip)5. Add lettuce and tomato (trust me, i was suprised too but it adds a crisp crunch and made me feel half way healthy)5. Genorous Dashes of as much Tabasco or Cholula to your liking6. add some hash browns (optional)7. Cut the sammich in half for the yolk explosion8. Eat it9.
