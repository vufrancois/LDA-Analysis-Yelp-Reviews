Our waiter was very attentive, decor also had a nice ambiance.On to the most important part, the food, the complimentary starter garlic bread was super good. Also had the crab cake as an appetizer, very flavorful and all crab not a lot of filler. Huge wine selection and honestly I was overwhelmed trying to make a choice on what to drink. For the main course, I had the fish pontchartrain, and it was sooooo good. It comes with mushroom rice, and I hate but our waiter told me not to worry it's mostly flavoring. I ended up enjoying the rice also. We also got the andouille macaroni and cheese which was the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. I would've been content with just a plate of that lol. Since it was my birthday, I was offered dessert. I got the beignets, they were good but I've definitely had better. I left happy and full with my leftovers :) I'd definitely go back.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=0,Rigo P.,"Houston, TX",1,18,,,11/7/17,"Made a reservation for our anniversary tonight and was not impressed by the service. I chose this place after reading about the exceptional service in Houston Press Magazine. However, my wife and I have been to other places that when made aware of a special occasion, they go above and beyond to make it special for you. We were greeted by an unfriendly hostess upon arrival. Our server was nice but nothing ordinary, didn't even introduce himself. Food was really good but because of the service and how it seemed that a special occasion was not treated like one compared to other places, I give it 3 stars. Ambience was great, very romantic. However, the food, decor and ambience may be great but if the service is poor, it makes the experience mediocre. Our serve came 3 times to our table. We had to ask for the ticket since he was running back and forth with other customers. I regret booking this place for my anniversary after realizing what other places do for you to make it special. Definitely won't be coming here again for any special occasion.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=0,Jordan W.,"Houston, TX",161,214,12,,9/18/17,"I came here for my birthday to try a fancy Cajun place. They do have a dress code here: no shorts, and dress as you would for work (business casual) and no street clothes. You only have the option to valet park because you would have to walk a ways if you were to street park. So being some cash. Anyway, this place is located on the edge of downtown, and I was actually amazed when I tried this restaurant.For an appetizer, I ordered the snapping turtle soup. This soup was an original dish from Louisiana, and I had never tried it before. The soup did have that Cajun flavor in it, and also was a little spicy. I enjoyed it because it was something that is a big part of my family's culture. I would find the recipe to make some at home.For my main course, I had some grilled fish, shrimp, and some fried oysters. The fish was cooked perfectly, the shrimp had that nice, tender flavor to it, and the oysters were very good and not too fishy. Overall, this entree was right up my alley because I've been enjoying seafood almost my whole life. To try it from another perspective, I really enjoyed the good flavors and the way the food was prepared.For dessert, we had some beignets, which are like little doughnuts, and I had a cookie like thing for my dessert. The beignets were really good with powdered sugar, and the cookies were really delicious, but somewhat a tad too sweet. But I enjoyed the desserts they have here. I would recommend coming here for a celebration or birthday dinner.If you want to try some fancy Cajun food from a good staff, and if you're living in the inner Houston area, come on down to this nice restaurant. I really enjoyed exploring Cajun food at a new level.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=0,Maria P.,"Houston, TX",82,45,71,Elite ’17,8/8/17,"Located in a charming house, the tables are spread throughout the many rooms and spaces of the building.

I guess. We had a dinner for a medical conference that was in town and had a tasting menu for dinner. I'll post the picture but I'll just tell you what I had to speed things up. Starter: gumbo - pretty delicious actually. But not that spicy. Which was disappointing. But the shrimp were on point and had good flavors. Salad: not sure but greens with a vinaigrette and entirely too much cheese. Entree: filet with mixed veggies. This is where they went and pissed me right off. It's set down and the filet is already cut. I asked for medium rare because that's how steak is eaten. If you disagree then you're a weirdo and can enjoy your hockey puck. The meat was cold and there was no juice to it. What happens when you cut meat before it's had time to rest. The veggies were bland and disgusting. But I was starving so they were eaten. Honestly one of the worst steaks I've ever had. I'd rank it up there with a sirloin from Golden Corral. Yeah. That bad. Dessert: bananas foster. This was the highlight of the night. Just soaked in sugars and ice cream. This dish saved it from a one star review. This dinner wasn't cheap. We had roughly 20 people here but it was close to 4K. Really over priced for what I had at least. Thank god we were splitting the bill. Honestly it wasn't that good. I checked out a real menu and was shocked how expensive it was. Maybe I just had a bad piece of meat. But if I'm sacrificing my diet I'd prefer to have it be delicious. The service was spot on.

We were seated in a room (there are several small rooms around the restaurant, really cool vibe) with plenty of others with a yellow ribbon on their tables, signifying a special event to the waiters/waitresses.

He got a mix of different seafood and I got the scallops. We also each had soup (lobster bisque and turtle soup). Everything was great. We had the divine bread pudding for dessert (and I don't even like bread pudding... or I didn't before that night). Our waiter was great, and they even brought a big paper chef's hat for the birthday boy to celebrate. I will be honest, I was a little surprised that a restaurant so nice wouldn't comp the dessert for the birthday boy or bring him a scoop of ice cream or something. But just know not to expect that going in. There are pralines you can take on your way out, and I recommend doing that... even if you're stuffed and need to save it for later.

We weren't in a hurry anyway. I ordered the Creole beef grillades with smashed Yukon potatoes, and it was a hearty dish that tasted a little creamy. Nothing to really wow me, though.

I don't get to see her much, and we splurged. Brennan's Brunch is a three course meal. You choose an entree priced between $32 and $45 and it comes with an appetizer and a dessert. It is very reasonably priced for the quality of the food. But today wasn't about reasonable charges... we wanted to splurge and we did. They had a delicious Petrossian caviar served with the traditional accompaniments and presented with four petite mother of pearl spoons on a mound of shimmering ice. The caviar had a pleasant soft pop and I had to restrain my inner voice who told me to eschew the accompaniments and eat it straight out of the bowl with a spoon. For my starter I chose a poached oyster stew in a roasted fennel cream. I have never experienced oysters this delicious cooked. They were plump, meaty and still held the brine that usually only survives a cold preparation; it was transcendent. I could easily eat this every day. The entree was an oyster cake and I chose to add lump crab poached in Chardonnay as a topper. I'm glad I did, the crab was absolutely perfect, sweet and meaty. To complete the meal, bananas foster was prepared table-side by our charming waiter, Big Jeff (Yes, it's even printed on his business card) and included a 3 foot tall tower of flame for its finale. From beginning to end, this was one of my favorite afternoons.

The meal began with complimentary garlic bread-winner! Buttery and chewy, a nice start to the meal. I opted for a Restaurant Weeks meal. The Brennan's salad was the first course. Here, my disappointment could be attributed to pure preference in taste. The vinaigrette had an ""olive-y"" flavor (and I believe that there were olives in the salad), which is not a flavor that I love. My spouse loved the salad. Just wasn't my fave flave(or). I ordered the filet mignon, which came with roasted veggies. The server recommended sharing a side of mac and cheese, so we added that as well. My steak was good! It had a nice char and it was cooked the way that I requested. The flavors were not unique, but it was a solid steak. The mac and cheese was okay-there is sausage included, which felt left like an afterthought. The sauce was creamy and a little spicy and fine. The veggies-carrots and shallots-were not good. Undercooked, cold, and lacking flavor:/ Dessert was bread pudding, and it was fine. It was boozy-a little too boozy. Brennan's was okay.

My daughter and I were invited to attend with some friends for Houston Restaurant week and enjoyed a wonderful brunch this morning. The service from the minute the valet opened my car door to when a different valet returned it to me was outstanding. I started with a mimosa and then chose Eggs Benedict and Bananas Foster for the entree and dessert. Every morsel was delicious and we very much enjoyed the show by the waiter when preparing our dessert table side. We were not rushed and spent about 1.5 hours visiting over our meals. Very pleasant made even more so by a jazz group traveling through the restaurant. Now for the chalkboard scratch.....as I started to pull away, I thought something hit my car. It was the valet knocking on the backseat driver side window so I lowered my window and he said, ""Valet is $5"", to which I replied, ""I know, I paid the valet who took my ticket."" Then the valet looks at another valet who's walking up and that one says, ""You already pay, to who, Victor?"" OMG, guys, how would I know anyone's name? So I get back out of my car to point out who I gave the $5 and valet ticket to. And then the 2nd guy says, ""Oh, ok."" And the first guy says, ""Sorry"" I'm sure the confusion was my fault since I've only previously used valet service when I'm with my husband and he deals with the valet/money. However, if I wasn't supposed to give money to the valet who took my ticket then he should have known to return it to me and tell me to give it to the valet who brings the car. How embarrassing and, really, I would choose to walk several blocks before using valet service again to avoid a scene like that!! I'm really trying to stay positively focused on my first impression but that last impression is hard to let go because I went from feeling almost euphoric after nibbling on that final praline to feeling like I just wanted to get the hell outta there in a matter of a minute!

I'd also recommend Brennan's for a pre-show bite, as they asked us upon entry if we were going to a show afterward (they try to move those people out in an extra-timely fashion).Food:As for main courses, I can highly recommend the crab cakes (no breading or frying, this isn't Red Lobster!), the grilled redfish with beet marinade, and pretty much all the seafood dishes for that matter.

Food, service, and atmosphere. What was an additional bonus is they are open till 10 pm on Sundays. I was jonesing to find a descent place that was open late on Sunday's (later than 8 pm) and ended up choosing Brennan's. To my surprise the place was quite busy still and the hostess found us a nice corner seat with highback chairs. Our waiter was nice and personable and spent time giving us a little history of the place and the longevity and quality of the wait staff. They all worked in rhythm in ordering the food, bringing it, clearing the table and asking if we need anything else. I really like the menu and very authentic Louisiana Cajun choices. Tonight we ordered the special lump crab cakes and from the menu pecan crusted gulf fish. They didn't have any issues to split the orders on two separate dishes and items came out no more than minutes after we placed the order (big points for that). I also added a cup of the turtle soup. I found all choices to 5 stars and the crab cakes were the best I've had in Houston, and there are a lot of places they say they have the the best. These didn't have any bread crumbs and I'm not exactly sure what they used to bind the crab meat but it was oh so good. Turtle soup is a must try too. Wine list was nice and the had a good list of wines by the glass. For desert they also have a very nice assortment of options from their bananas foster to the familiar beignets and a reasonable list of coffee cocktails. I chose the bread pudding, every on the look out for the best. Was it the best, well I would give it 4 out of 5. Very tasty and right size. Brennan's has been a place I haven't come for a long time, but will change that trend.

As we were reviewing the brunch options on the menu, an individual at my table of 7 had a question regarding gluten content of the shrimp and grits dish. As the waiter passed by our table, I politely asked him to stop for a brief question. He did stop but was quite annoyed when he realized we had ""food"" related quested. Instead of a simple yes or no response, he proceeded to tell me in a less than pleasant reply, ""I will be back to address the menu and all food related questions in a few minutes"" and then proceeded to walk away. My guests and I were stunned by his arrogance. Note that the restaurant was less the 30% occupied at this time. This is certainly not what you would expect from a waiter in this restaurant!!He was much more accommodating as the meal went on, hopefully realizing what an ___ he had been.

We were able to get dropped off and picked up with relative ease, without having to deal with the hassle of parking! That was definitely wonderful -- the service was prompt and the driver was friendly and courteous.However, the meal portion of our visit did not live up to the hype. We were very excited about having a great meal before going to the theater. We knew we'd have to rush it since the restaurant didn't seat until 5:45pm and we had to get on the shuttle bus by 7pm. We had a reservation, so we only waited a couple of minutes before being whisked away to a table appointed with very comfortable chairs.Once we were seated, our waiter brought us our drinks and menus. We then proceeded to decide what we wanted to eat, but had to wait quite a while for the waiter to return to take our order. He told us he was aware we were going to catch the shuttle bus so he would take care of us and make sure we made it! We felt relieved. But as the hour continued, we realized that wouldn't be the case. Our appetizers came out and that took up the bulk of our time at the table. I believe about 45 minutes of the time we were at the table was spent ordering, getting the appetizers, and eating them. Once they were cleared, we saw our entrees being brought out. They sat unattended for another 5 minutes before we asked about the timing. Since our waiter was nowhere in sight (we hadn't seen him for at least 15 minutes), we asked another member of the waitstaff walking by. He said he didn't know anything about it, and didn't provide us with any kind of resolution. We waited a couple more minutes before the waiter returned to serve us our entrees.We had about 10 minutes, if that, to finish our entrees before we needed to pay and get out the door! The food was also not incredibly flavorful or delicious. We didn't enjoy the shrimp appetizer we ordered or the soup. My entree all tasted one-note (salty, but without a lot of actual flavor). None of the food was impressive, especially for the price. It tasted on-par with meals I could have gotten for a third of the price. All of my dining companions noted that the quality and taste did not meet expectations.All in all, we were very impressed with the shuttle service -- but neither the food nor the service lived up to the hype. Sure we were disappointed with the food, but mostly, we were disappointed with paying $40+ per entree to have 10 minutes to finish them. We didn't get the kind of attention from our waiter that you come to expect at fine establishments, which would have helped to speed up the down time at the beginning as well as the time between appetizers and entrees. It would have also allowed me time to get the bananas foster (one of my absolute fave desserts).

Anyone who reads my reviews knows that I am a huge fan of bread, and I greatly judge restaurants based on their bread basket. Well, Brennan's gets points because they have strips of garlic bread that they put on your plate before appetizers, and then they have a pretty basic French roll, which they give you during appetizers. The French roll isn't really anything special, but the garlic bread is fantastic! I began my dinner with the soup of the day, which was a crawfish tortilla soup. I thought it was good, but it was pretty spicy. There were plenty of crawfish in it though, so I will give them points on that! For my main course, I ordered the duck, and it was so delicious.

We had a really wonderful experience dining out here and I am already looking forward to going back once I'm in Houston again.The only thing about our dinner that I didn't love was our waiter. He was a bit too attentive. He rushed us to order food before we could finish deciding on what bottle of wine we wanted to order. He also made it a point to stand right by our table the entire night staring at us to see if we needed anything. As much as I appreciate a helpful waiter, I would have preferred a little less hands on so that I could enjoy my night instead of constantly being interrupted to see if we needed anything.Besides the overly helpful waiter, the night started off brilliantly with our bottle of Pinot Noir and the complimentary garlic bread. The warm, buttery garlic bread was so amazing that we asked for more. There were so many appetizers on the menu that I wanted to try that we had to pick two of them, which were the Shrimp and Andouille Sausage Gumbo and the Crawfish Enchilada, both coming out at separate times. The gumbo was great. There were a lot of shrimp in the cup, so I couldn't complain one bit. The enchilada was very different from what I expected, in a great way. It was a taste of both Mexican and Cajun all in one plate and all of those flavors combined so well together.I ordered the Red Snapper Pontchartrain, which was topped with shrimp and fried oysters. The fried oysters were the highlight of the night. I am not a fan of oysters, but these were out of this world good. I can't explain how outstanding this entire dish was.I also got some of the Hunter's Mix Bag, and this eclectic dish wowed us with a little bit of sweet and savory all together. I recommend this for any big meat lovers.For a side, we opted for the Crawfish Fried Rice. I imagined this to be an Asian flavored dish with crawfish in it, but it wasn't! It was a Cajun tasting dish only being inspired by Asian flare. It was great and I can't wait to try and replicate it at home, even though I know I won't stand a chance.Our dinner was brilliant!

The service was excellent and we were never left waiting around for the next course.The ambiance was serine-romantic lighting with a soft string quartet playing in the background.Now for the food-I am a vegetarian and going in, I knew my options would be sparse.

Upon arriving, I noticed how well-decorated and elegant the downstairs area was. We got seated upstairs, in a banquet overflow room with absolutely no decor and only 9 tables. We were too polite and didn't ask to be moved, but at least 5 other parties refused to sit there while we stayed.We did the $35 price fix menu and ordered the turtle soup, filet mignon, and bananas foster. The soup came out immediately, and was alright. It honestly just tasted like beef stew with some Tabasco in it to me and it was luke warm. Then things took a turn for the worse; the filets came out. The main courses were both cooked horribly. The steaks were cold and really chewy and looked like they hadn't even seared them. The random root vegetables that were served with them were raw and rock hard. My boyfriend even had a woody stem scrap of broccoli that should've been trashed on his plate. The dessert was better but the ice cream had chunks of ice in it.Joey, our waitress was sweet and attentive, so we didn't want to make her day any worse by complaining.

While we were waiting a member of the valet crew asked us to move to the side of the restaurant, which we found odd.

Nice atmosphere, outstanding service, high prices.Brennan's is a part of Houston history, and is a sister restaurant to the famous Commander's Palace in New Orleans. My wife and friends get Brennan's and Brenner's mixed up...just remember the latter is a steak house.I have always wanted to try Brennan's and was able to attend a Christmas lunch with some coworkers.As we arrived, we had to circle a couple of times to find a parking spot. Note that this part of midtown has quite a few lofts and it is difficult to find parking in the street, especially at lunchtime. We did find a spot two blocks away. Valet parking is also offered by the restaurant. One piece of advice is to be careful driving on Smith street too far, since it turns into a highway 59 entrance a block or two past Brennan's.We were led to a table upstairs and given a Christmas bell on a lanyard. The restaurant was busy and I noticed another company had a private room reserved across from us.The location is beautiful without being pretentious. There is a dress code, but it is not extreme...it adds to the charm.We were given a Christmas menu that had appetizers, entrees and desserts listed...but no prices. Luckily, one of my coworkers had sent a copy of the menu earlier that day via email (with prices), so I knew what to expect.The bread basket came filled with delicious half-slices of French bread that have a slight cheese taste. This is a must try.I started with the turtle soup. This is one dish that Brennan's is known for, and I did enjoy it. The soup by itself is filing, and I would definitely order it again. My entree was a pecan-crusted mani-mahi filet. It was a nice, thick piece of fish, but there was nothing special about the taste. The sauce was a bit bland and I expected more for a $25 piece of fish.I tried some of my coworker's bread pudding, and it was very rich and delicious. The portion size is probably good for two people. I had a couple cups of coffee that were very strong/bold, just like I like it.Service was excellent. We had constant refills, leftovers packaged for us, and the bill was split 10 ways without a mandatory 18% tip added to the total.On the way out, I had a tasty pecan praline. Make sure you grab one before you exit.With the extra things like the Christmas bell, cheese bread, pralines, and coffee as well as the overall ambience, I can see Brennan's being a great place for celebrations and special occasions, but not for a workday lunch. My lunch was $45 with tip for an appetizer and entree, and I didn't feel that the overall quality of the food justified the price. I would like to return in the future sometime (perhaps for an anniversary) and try a different entree.3.5 stars for the food5 stars for everything else","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=80,Jasmine R.,"Houston, TX",731,226,751,Elite ’17,10/6/14,"I really did enjoy my dinner.

Parking is easy via valet in front of the restaurant. The neighborhood has an authentic southern, Louisiana feeling (though I haven't actually been to LA-state yet, I imagine this is what it's like based on movies & pictures). The decor is very classy & elegant with the ""Business Casual"" dress code. Staff is as friendly/polite as they come starting at the moment you step onto the threshold. The first time I visited was for a private reception held in a small ballroom upstairs. The staff was super attentive up there, served everyone drinks very quickly and created a comfortable environment for a classy group of people. Months later, I finally came for dinner on a Monday night (tonight!) just before Mardi Gras for a pretty quiet evening. The chairs (rather, armchairs) in the dining hall are fantastic -- huge, cushiony, and spacious. It's like you're sitting in your own private space with your dinner companions. The wait staff were top-notch, super polite, cheerful, helpful, and attentive.The food itself was FABULOUS & fully satisfying to the tastebuds.

You might have to walk a little, but it's a nice area so I didn't mind. I love how polite everybody is here! I have never been to a restaurant with such great service. Not only were the servers attentive and friendly, but when my sister ordered something that the kitchen ran out of, the chef came to our table to apologize and said she could order ANYTHING and they would make it. Now keep in mind, we came for HRW so there was supposed to be a set menu, and here he was saying she didn't even have to order off of the regular menu! Any other restaurant would've just gotten a server to apologize and asked her to choose something else, but the professionalism and politeness of the staff here left me in awe. (Request being seated in Aaron's section, he's one of the best and friendliest servers I've ever met, and do not forget to tip generously, he deserves it!)Snapping Turtle Soup: I've heard so much about the turtle soup at Brennan's, so I expected it to be amazing. I don't know if I just don't appreciate turtle meat or if I got a bad batch, but I felt like the turtle had a weird texture and was very tough. The actual soup, however, was good. Filet Mignon Tchoupitoulas: This whole dish was just delicious and cooked perfectly. It may not look like a lot to most people, but I found this dish very filling on its own. Creole Bread Pudding: I loved the presentation and found it difficult to mess it up. But I just had to try it, being an avid bread pudding fan. This wasn't the best bread pudding I've had, but it was still very good. I would have preferred it without pecans though. Bananas Foster: This delicious, sweet dessert is famously prepared tableside by your server, as you can see by the countless photos on yelp (to which I will add :), and produces a large flame that can be considered a show to enjoy. Be careful though, because if you're close enough, you'll feel the heat when it flames up. If you order this, I hope you appreciate just how much the servers here have to do and tip accordingly, because not only are you getting great service and food, but a little bit of entertainment.

It is a two story restaurant nestled in downtown with multiple beautiful dining rooms. As a Houston native, I knew HRW was the perfect opportunity to try it and I was not disappointed! It was $35 per person for 3 courses and a $5 from each meal goes towards the Houston food bank. Eating for a good cause!! Appetizer- I tried the famous turtle soup. Although it was quite delicious, I found it to be a bit salty for my taste. - My friend had the soup du jour which was the crab bisque that night. We both agreed that his soup was better. Entree- I had the filet mignon with potato purée, roasted mushrooms, and caramelized onions. I ordered it medium rare and it was executed beautifully! Absolutely delicious. Definitely beat my friend's entree. - My friend ordered the iron-seared salmon over sautéed peppers, onions, corn, and okra. Although it did taste good with the combo of veggies, I've definitely had better salmon before. Dessert- I tried the creole bread pudding. I have a huge sweet tooth and I usually love bread pudding but I wasn't that impressed with this one. It would have been better if it was served warm and with ice cream but it wasn't :( I don't think I'm a fan of the rye whiskey sauce either - my friend had the traditional bananas foster which seems to be a yelp favorite. They make it right in front of your table which is pretty cool with the flames. at least this dish comes with some pretty yummy ice cream! But I wasn't blown away by the dish overall. The filet mignon entree was definitely my favorite course. On our way out, we asked a waiter to take our picture. We asked him to pick a nice place in the restaurant to take it. He chose two lovely spots. My favorite one was at the top of the staircase in front of the chandelier. He also took us on a tour of the upstairs banquet rooms and the kitchen (they apparently have the largest restaurant kitchen in Houston). It was an awesome way to end our dinner. They also have a plate of complimentary pralines at the door to grab on your way out. I was already stuffed but those little suckers are delicious! Btw, it's complimentary valet, just tip. Fun fact: There is a scene from Jack Nicholson's 1983 movie Terms of Endearment that was filmed at Brennan's!!","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=100,David B.,"Houston, TX",30,57,2,,8/14/16,"I wish I was on the 5 star side of the reviews but our party of 5, out for a special occasion celebration, had a very 3 star experience.

However, I would still suggest making plans ahead of time, as we were seated at a table in the outer corner of the main dining area, and the lighting was unpleasantly dim. As for the food, I ordered the turtle soup and stuffed quail. My mom also got the soup but ordered grilled red snapper for her entree. Their signature turtle soup was tasty as always, but my quail was kind of disappointing. The bird itself was tiny and not tender enough, and the whole dish was overly sweet. The best part was the cornbread stuffing. My mom's fish was also not soft enough, and the veggies it was paired with were rather soggy. Since it was my birthday, they provided a special bananas foster for dessert - by special I just mean they stuck a candle in the ice cream and gave me a birthday hat. Be warned - this isn't complimentary. We still had to pay $9 at the end for it. I say with regret that the bananas foster was the worst part of the meal, since it was the one dish I had been looking forward to the most. The table side presentation was cool as always, but when I actually tried the dessert, I realized that the server had put way too much rum in it. The alcohol definitely overpowered the rest of the ingredients, and I don't particularly like the taste of alcohol. I'm not sure if the chefs just weren't on top of things that day or if the overall quality of Brennan's food has just depreciated.

I had to remind myself I was there for an actual meal so not to eat all of it and ruin my appetite. However, on my way out I did manage to grab a napkin full. No shame. To start off the three course meal, I had the turtle soup on the recommendations of yelpers and gotta say it was pretty good. Nice and flavorful, and they even provided sweet cornbread and cheddar jack cheese(?) bread to accompany it.For the main course I had decided on the l stuffed quail and Lord have mercy did I choose wisely. That dish was delicious af. The cornbread stuffing was on point, and the fig braised cabbage complimented the quail so well. The only downside was probably that it was so filling, and I had to pace myself so that I still had room for dessert. And thank the Lord almighty that I did leave room for dessert cause that bananas foster was to die for! Our server Felix did a splendid job with making it table side and added just enough cinnamon and rum to make your taste buds sing. He even gave us a little history lesson on how the dish was created. So props to that. Also make note of their business casual dress code!

Richard, our server, was personable, professional and attentive ... what we'd expect at such a Houston icon.

Worse still, one of our dining companions spotted a hair on his plate, in addition to his filet cooked almost rare (he ordered it medium well). Of course, management took care of the issues immediately ... but it never should have happened at a world class restaurant. My fish dinner was nicely presented and tasty ... but not up to what I expect at a high-end establishment. The accompanying sides were ordinary.What personally peeves me most, however, is the $5 charge for parking ... and no facilities for the disabled, which I'm certain violates ADA criteria (we have a handicap placard). At Brennan's prices, parking should be complimentary (it is at many places elsewhere).

The food was just ok (nothing out of this world), but the service was absolutely horrible. They started off by bringing water and butter to the table, but didn't leave anything like bread or crackers. Even after the meal, and a day later, I'm still uncertain as to why the butter was there. Next, we had to get the servers attention to let him know that we were ready to order. He hadn't come back by our table because he and another server were busy flirting with women at another table, which is extremely unprofessional, but do your thing. I was getting ""hangry"", flirt on your own time. After ordering, some time went by and we hadn't received our wine. I had to remind the server. After receiving our wine I noticed cork screw residue at the bottom of the glass, and he was kind enough to bring another. Then, the server stacked our courses. This was so frustrating. He literally brought the second course about 5 minutes after the first course. He is was apologetic, so he knew it was inappropriate, but if you catch that, turn around and come back when the timing is right. Don't just drop it off and then be like ""my bad you guys"". As I said before, the food was ""ok"", but the steak had to of been one of the worst steaks I've had in my left, and that's saying a lot. The term bland doesn't do justice for how this steak really tasted. Sooooo disappointing. I will say that the desert was the best course. We had the banana fosters and bread pudding souflet, which were great. All in all, I think this restaurant has potential, but could use a new crew of wait staff. There were 3 guys total that were helping us out and all were very unprofessional. The part that really frustrated me the most, was the fact that they spent most of their time flirting or standing around the dining room talking and laughing. I'm not saying don't have a good time at work, but I AM saying there is a time and a place for everything, and 5 feet from our table, while we are trying to have conversation of our own, is NOT the place to have yours.

And I will take responsibility for part of the deduction as I did not look up dress code before arriving. I am an out of towner from the Bay Area, CA where brunch is a big part of life. So I took an Uber to this spot after researching best brunch spots in Houston (that did not refer to dress code). So I showed up in my obligatory CA Saturday day time dress attire of lulu lemon and converse with baseball cap. Here's where the one star deduction comes. As soon as I stepped in I knew. So I asked for a table with the intention of heading to the restroom to remove my hat and make myself presentable, thank goodness for my cardigan I grabbed last minute. There were two hosts. The male was pleasant. They both did give me the up and down and then the blonde female hostess suggested the bar which I was happy to sit at. (She later came over to the bar to talk to someone and did the same once over look again. Please ma'am I'm aware, it's time to stop with the looks and do your job as hostess and welcome me as a patron.) I then made my best attempt at wardrobe adjustment in the restroom. The welcome was not a welcome at all, and while I do accept I did not look at dress code....THAT ASIDE... insert 5 star here. As soon as I sat down at the bar, Christine approached me with a smile and welcome and assured me I was not out of place. She took time to review the menu and drinks with me. She took time and pleasure in doing her job. I ended up spending at least two hours, enjoying the delicious food and drinks. The shrimp and grits honestly the best I've ever had. Hands down. The presentation of all was gorgeous down to the beignets. While I enjoyed my bourbon aperitif, I asked Christine for recommendations on places to go this evening, only to find Sebastian the pastry chef sitting at the bar waiting to start his shift. Not only did he give great recommendations but also called a friend who does functions in the city to verify. This to me is above and beyond. So long story short, if you're looking for a great spot with amazing food and bar tender you've found it. Just dress yourself according to the standard or expect to get the Pretty Woman treatment on arrival. To the management of Brennan's, what an absolute gem you have in Christine.

Gentleman - if you're not wearing a suit, you should definitely throw on a blazer. Secondly, make reservations. I've never been one for ""fine dining"": stuffy, over-sophisticated ambiance and forced discourse. And those sparkly white plates with those teeny tiny speckles of food. Do they use tweezers to place that food on that plate? Brennan's is fine dining, but with a significant infusion of Texas and Louisiana Creole charm. It's sophisticated, but not at all stuffy. While you should dress up, you're going to feel great and have one of the best meals of your life. The atmosphere is approaching ethereal status. The restaurant itself is huge with multiple seating areas; each of which is different. If the weather is right, you'd be foolish not to consider the patio. Before I talk about the food, though, know that it's pricey. Two people, one drink each, one soup each and two mains came to $130 before tip.Vegetarians beware; this is not your place. But for the carnivores (and even pescatarians), this is culinary heaven. The portions are substantial. - The turtle soup is divine. Now transparently I *think* there's turtle in it? A little Raphael, Donatello, Michelangelo and Leonardo. Yum. And a sprinkle of sherry on top that pulls it all together. - The blue crab stuffed flounder is what dreams are made of. A rather insane deluge of flavors and textures, in addition to fish that's cooked perfectly. WOW. - The pecan crusted gulf fish is exquisite. If you don't like fish, try this and your mind will be changed. - You really (seriously) have to get the bananas foster for dessert. Even if you don't like bananas, the tableside preparation compete with 10-foot high flame is worth it. Houston is lucky to have Brennan's.

And it is lovelier in person.H & I went to Brennan's for the HRW brunch. I've been craving turtle soup & this is the place to get it (outside of NOLA). We decided on the early brunch (10am) & arrived a few minutes so we headed to the bar & ordered a couple bloody Mary's. We barely sipped our drinks before a waiter appeared to seat us. As mentioned the room is gorgeous & intimate. On the small side but beats sitting out in the main room.

They were friendly & we had fun chatting with them yet they knew when to leave us alone. I found out our waiter, Robert is hapa....just like me! We joked a bit about being raised by a Japanese mother, where we were born, etc. Within 5 minutes we were old pals. Then the food started hitting the table. Both soups were divine! H's bisque had big chunks of crab in it & the turtle soup was delicious with a bit of a kick. OMGosh, the eggs b were divine! Super soft & lightly toasted English muffins topped with several slices of duroc ham & freakin' delicately poached eggs topped with a wonderfully tangy hollandaise. The yolks were runny & rich I was tempted to lick the plate clean. By this time I was extremely full & told H I couldn't eat another bite....until the dessert was placed in front of me. Small beignets nestled in a bowl with a side of café au lait anglaise for dunking. This creamy sauce had a hint of much loved chicory coffee. ""I thought you said you couldn't eat another bite"", H said. Humh? Oh heck, there's always room for beignets! H started motioning to his mouth. What you want a bite? No. Then what? Check your mouth. Oh. I quickly looked in the mirror beside our table & was greeted with a vision of me with powder sugar all around my lips. Being all lady-like I daintily dabbed the powder sugar away with my napkin. This place is definitely worth the visit any time but for brunch during HRW, you get a heck of a deal. AND please people, this place has a dress code.

It's the most wonderful time of the year- Houston Restaurant Weeks. You have already scrutinized all the menus and drafted a program of all the restaurants you will hit up. Obviously, you select the most expensive ones to get the best bang for your buck, narrow them down using the dessert options, and verify your picks on Yelp. Tell me I am not alone in doing this.Brennan's is one of those restaurants that every Houstonian must visit at least once, just to say you have. On my reservation, I made sure they took note that we were celebrating L's birthday. They promised a decorated table, complimentary pecan pralines with a candle, and a chef's hat! Um, can I get in on this too? My half birthday was not too long ago... There is a strict business casual dress code. One of my friends wore a SUIT, and we STILL didn't get seated in the main dining room. Disappointing, but my guess is they wanted to separate the HRW scrubs from their more affluent guests. No matter, our dining area was exquisite- it looked like a setting from a wedding magazine, which pleased the hopeless romantic in me. Service was impeccable. L was late because she had mistakenly driven to Brenner's on the Bayou instead, and our server graciously asked the kitchen to hold off on her order. He also kept the bread flow going, which was a great deal of work. My guy friends EACH devoured 10+ pieces of cheesy garlic bread. For reference, I had 2 and was already full. Choices for the first course were turtle soup, salad, and crab & corn bisque (soup du jour). Nobody got the salad, because really? This should require no explanation. The turtle soup lives up to its fame, and is good enough that you won't feel a twinge of guilt eating an endangered species. The crab & corn bisque is on point. There's a fair amount of crab meat in it. Thanks for not being stingy just because it's restaurant week! I chose the salmon for my main course. It's rather easy to overcook salmon and have it taste almost chalky, but this was one of the better versions I've had. The beef grillades were tasty, and the Parmesan flavor was potent in the grits. We violated social etiquette in a classy restaurant by singing happy birthday for L. Nobody around us seemed bothered though, and we even received a few smiles. The $20 HRW menu does not include a dessert, so we ordered the summer strawberry shortcake and the creole bread pudding. The strawberry shortcake wasn't that exciting. Despite being a short person, and a cake person, I'm just not a shortcake person. The bread pudding was amaaaaaazing. I didn't hold back on that one. On your way out, there is a platter of pecan pralines for you to take to-go. How many I grabbed is not important.

The strolling band for special occasions was a delight. One of our servers was friendly.The negatives: The service was hit or miss, mostly miss. We were seated for 10 minutes before even being approached by a server. Only half the tables were occupied at first, so we had no idea why we waited so long. Turns out we had two servers for a 10-table room, one main waiter (Francisco) and an assistant (Paul). Francisco was knowledgeable and friendly. Paul seemed surly. Francisco asked if we wanted anything to drink before we'd even been given menus. We were taken aback so he suggested he bring us some waters and bread (bread&water?) for the time being. I asked for menus. Ten minutes later we got waters from Paul, but the promised bread didn't come with it. Still no menus. Every stage of the meal except paying the check involved lots of waiting for one of the servers to reappear in the area.The food at brunch, while tasty enough, was not particularly memorable. The eggplant soup was bland and had a slightly creepy, gummy texture. While it was served warm, none of it was hot. This was true of all three soups and all three entrees. When the soups were deposited unceremoniously in front of us, I wondered if the turtle soup had already come with the sherry in it, or if it would be added table-side, like they do in New Orleans. Nobody said anything when it was placed in front of me. He just dashed off. So I assumed it was in there and started eating. A couple minutes later, after I'd eaten part of it, Paul reappeared and without saying a word, dumped sherry in my soup and left again. Later, I saw Francisco explain the sherry to another table when their soup was served so I could see it was supposed to be part of the presentation. Imagine if I hadn't already been familiar with the sherry-in-the-turtle-soup ritual from a visit to New Orleans (where the waiter ASKED before adding it) and somebody just walked up and dumped something unknown in my soup and walked away in a hurry.Francisco did ask us three times how the food tasted after we received it. Though the food should have been hotter, I wasn't willing to invest even more time in waiting for it to be taken back and returned. The flavor was fine, though unremarkable. I chalked it up to a lesson learned, since I had ignored so many comments on Yelp that had said the same thing.Toward the end of the meal, Francisco and Paul started to reconfigure a table at the far end of the narrow room. They wheeled a very large, circular, ugly particle board table top through the middle of the room a foot from my table and converted a square table into a circular table. Nice construction ambience there in a small space. And it made me want to check under my tablecloth to see if it was particle board, too. All in all, not the dignified, elegant dining experience you expect from a location with a refined dress code. I learned a $100 dollar lesson I won't repeat.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=160,Craig R.,"Houston, TX",2,71,27,,9/4/15,"Back for my first time since the place burnt during a storm.

Brennan's is a two-story building with multiple dining rooms on both floors, similar to the famous restaurants you'll see in the French Quarter in NOLA (and owned by the same family, if I'm not mistaken). The decor is classic without being too overwhelming or kitschy. Parking is the usual Midtown struggle, but valet was a reasonable $5 so definitely consider that if you're having trouble finding street parking/don't want to hike to the restaurant in heels. We ordered:First course:- Snapping turtle soup for me - if you're coming to Brennan's this is a must-try. The soup was hot, flavorful, and well-seasoned, and the sherry added a nice kick and brought out the flavors even more. I could see myself surviving on this stuff when it gets colder outside. Served with a thick slice of bread for dipping.- Soup du jour for my friend - the option that day was some sort of jalapeno cheese soup. I'm not into overly cheesy dishes (and honestly it looked like queso), but she had no complaints.Second course:- Filet mignon Tchoupitoulas - we both ordered this medium rare. The filets were cooked perfectly, and was nicely complemented by the vegetables and potato puree (is that just a fancy name for mashed potatoes?). The sweetness of the honey glaze was a little off-putting at first, but somehow it worked. Would probs order again.Third course:- Creole bread pudding - decent, albeit nothing special. The strawberry garnish was a nice touch but the whiskey sauce was a little too overpowering.- Beignets for my friend - these were on the smaller side (think of about 6-8 of those Totino's pizza rolls) and could have used some more powdered sugar, but the creme sauce was a nice touch. The service was hit-or-miss, however. There was a fairly long wait to have our orders taken, and additional fairly long waits between each course. Our dining room (we were on the second floor) was full, and I understand that it was peak hours on a busy nights, but a heads up from our waiter wouldn't have hurt. And when it came time for the bill, he just sort of dropped it on our table and walked away...ok.

I could eat them for the rest of my life and be happy. Next time, I will skip the steak, it was ok, and just demand an entire plate full of the mushrooms and obviously, if they think a few on top of a steak counts as a side (whereas if I had stuck to the original side, it would have been 5-10x the weight in food), then I will need to be extremely specific on what counts as a plate of an order so that I don't get 4 mushrooms for $30.The pralines are gross.

I guess this is one of those places you either love it or hate it; I'm the latter I guess.Brunch is at least $32 -$40 (not including your beverage) and consist of 1 soup or salad, 1 entree, and 1 dessert. One example of an entree was a pouched egg with two pancakes. Really!Almost every brunch entree includes a pouched egg so you better like raw egg. The pouched egg on everything does not make it a gourmet meal neither does the high price. A crab cake with a pouched egg. Grits with shrimp. We were in a large group so there was a varied assortment of courses chosen, none that impressive for the price. Some of the desserts were amazing, some good, and several just OK. However, the pralines that are available near the door - TRY them, they are delicious!There is no self parking, so be prepared to pay the required $5 for valet. The servers were friendly and most were quick to respond to our requests. They did bring everyones food out at the same time as noted by other reviewers. However, they got our orders mixed up and had to take them back until they could sort out who had which dish. In fact, when we attempted to tell them they had it wrong one of the servers told us no and started to argue with us until they realized maybe we did know what we actually ordered after all.I'm told the dinner menu is more impressive, but after this brunch experience I don't believe it is worth returning to try it.

From our experience, I believe they need to take greater care in their customer service, wait staff training and professionalism. For the price you pay, I've had much better service at lower quality restaurants.To begin, we made a reservation for three. When we arrived, they said they only had us down for two. The hostess continued to tell my party that we only booked for two and they would have to switch things all around for us to seat us. We certainly didn't book for two and we don't need to argue about it or feel like we're inconveniencing the staff. The wait staff was unpolished to say the least. People were dropping things on the floor, our waiter was rushing us and didn't get our orders correct. We were brought food that we didn't order. The wait staff said, ""oh sorry well you can have it anyway"". When asked if the dish had any mushrooms or pork, as one has a food allergy and one doesn't eat meat, the wait staff said, ""no it's just macaroni and cheese. None of that"". Well low and behold it had pork. It's unfortunate that they don't comprehend the severity of food allergies. If that were mushrooms, out would have came the epi pen and 911 call. As for food coming out timely, that was also an issue. It came out one dish at a time, maybe 10 minutes apart. So there you are with a $50 plate of food while the person next to you hasn't received their food yet and you're waiting as your food gets cold. They brought out a cup of gumbo while we waited so everyone could eat together which was a nice gesture but the gumbo was very bland. Lastly they straight didn't bring one of the main courses. As far as apps go, we got the shrimp and scallops. The scallops were deliciously cooked. Absolutely perfect. The shrimp throughout the app, gumbo and main course tasted like cheap cocktail shrimp from the frozen section of the grocery store. That was disappointing. Desserts were very well executed and the wine selection was grand. Ambience is very old world country club. Don't get me wrong. The food itself was pretty good.

The first time was a great experience with good food and good service. However, tonight my girlfriend and I decided to dine here on the Houston Restaurant Week menu. To start we were taken up to the banquet room upstairs (which is comparable to a hotel big banquet room), which is nowhere near as nice as the main dining room upstairs, a mood killer. It was a Wednesday and the downstairs was wide open at the time of our booking, meaning that the are clearly routing the HRW participants to another room.To start I ordered the turtle soup, which was good, but a bit salty. For the main I chose the Filet Mignon, my girlfriend ordered this as well. This was the chewiest and least flavorful steak I have ever had in my life, I would strongly recommend you skip this option. She barely even ate half, and ended up discarding some of it due to its chewiness (which is unacceptable as she had ordered the steak to be cooked medium). On the upside, and as usual, the bananas foster was great.Because of the very poor quality of the food we called the manager over, who promptly dealt with the situation in a professional manner that we appreciated. She knew the upstairs was clearly not as nice as the downstairs (even though she wouldn't admit they were putting the people who requested HRW in the worst area, as cited in other reviews on yelp), but she took our concerns about the food appropriately.In the end, I'm not sure if I will ever show up again, it wasn't near worth the money, even on Houston Restaurant Week.

The main dishes arrival times were not coordinated well which left a delay in each table commencing to eat since not every party member had their main dish in a timely manner. The servers seemed bothered by supplying to-go boxes for the food since the dinner program speaker completed the presentation before the dessert arrived. Perhaps they are better equipped to serve a party of 2 to 4 people; however, the food was not enjoyable enough to come back and witness this experience.","alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=180,William B.,"Houston, TX",7,24,9,,3/26/16,"We had our 16th Anniversary Dinner here and after a cocktail and Jimmy's wood grilled oysters in their famous courtyard, we were shown to our table. In classic style we were treated with ""Happy Anniversary"" and our table was set with a gold ribbon. Kim started with the renown Turtle Soup, I cannot resist the Gumbo. We split an order of their beautiful bread less lump crab cakes, then onto the main course. Brennan's prepares a snapper Pontchartrain like no other. A well prepared filet sits atop a scoop of dirty rice. It was covered in lump crab, grilled shrimp with a Cajun butter sauce. Perfectly fried oysters surround the main event. Kim noted that over the years they have adjusted their sauce to suit today's healthier eating so even with generous portions the ""rich"" factor was skillfully dialed down. Wally was our waiter with excellent service and food commentary. Doren skillfully worked our table as well and she took over with our coffee, Bananas Foster flambé and Mississippi Mud pie. Both desserts were emblazoned with our 16th Anniversary in chocolate.The only disappointment of the evening was an unfortunate delivery of a Sazarac cocktail, without the requisite Cointreau and too much bitters. The result was a disturbingly pink undrinkable beverage. The bartender quickly replaced it with an excellent Rye Manhattan and adjusted our check.

Specifically selected the Brennan's Bar for what I expected to be a quiet, relaxing, pleasant, late afternoon Happy Hour location. Could not have been more wrong. Was NOT the fault of the Bartender who was proficient & professional, but the sloppy, unprofessional surrounding confusion by other employees. Was such a turn-off that we left far earlier than expected, & moved to another nearby restaurant. We were the only customers at the bar when a Manager arrived at the other end, & asked the Bartender to help him start counting out cash. On & on & on. Loud conversation, banging on the bar, big frenzy of employees coming & going. Let the Bartender FOCUS on the bar customers, & let management perform this job elsewhere, out of sight of customers. Twenty minutes later 2 other customers arrive to meet with who we assume was Brennan's Catering Manager, to begin the L O U D planning for an event. The Brennan's employee kicked off the meeting by walking into the bar & telling the just-arrived customers: ""What a day. Had to deal with some Redneck SOB"". Really? An employee, especially someone in Management (??), uses this language with customer's in hearing-range? This guy was either totally clueless, or needs massive training on how to function ""inside"" the restaurant. He then sat down directly next to the bar with the customers, & began the deal-making. Is there NO OTHER PLACE in Brennan's where this kind of business negotiation can take place? Perhaps in an office where it SHOULD take place? Or perhaps a corner of the dining room that is TOTALLY empty at 4:45 in the afternoon? Not this guy. In the center of bar for all to hear, & there was NO problem hearing him. Just ignoring him. Come on Senior Brennan's Management -- stop this nonsense. Get control of your employees & give them better training. Brennan's has been a wonderful place with good food for many years, but this visit had all the welcoming charm of a shopping mall food court.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=200,Dina X.,"Houston, TX",10,49,49,,8/25/14,"Came here with bf for anniversary dinner -great decor / atmosphere, great service, delicious food.

I decided to take advantage of this, so I made a reservation to have dinner with my boyfriend at Brennan's of Houston.Brennan's, I had heard, is one of the nicest fine dining restaurants in Houston. The food there was supposedly incredible, and as it is not an inexpensive place, why not try it out for $35 a person, which includes a 3-course meal?Spoiler alert: The food was great, but the service was a major disappointment. Total bummer, because as you know, I want to LOVE everything! But alas...So my experience at Brennan's.It's very beautiful inside this Cajun fine dining spot. The restaurant is lined with exposed brick, several chandeliers hang from the ceilings, and soft paintings adorn the walls.And I will say, the food was exceptional. Before any of our food came out, we were given a plate of small pieces of cheesy garlic toast. These complimentary little guys were my second favorite thing that we had. They were gooey, crispy, and packed with garlicky goodness. Excellent little starters.Now in my humblest of opinions, I'm a pretty adventurous eater. Alligator, escargot, rabbit, and sweet breads are all in the spectrum of things I've tried. While I likely won't be caught eating bugs or snake anytime soon, I have been known to take a risk or two. So when I heard about the Turtle Soup at Brennan's I knew that I would have to try it as my first course. I quickly got over any reservations I had about it as I tasted this delicious gumbo-like soup. Heavy on the tomato base, and quite briny, it was not at all what I had expected. But it was fantastic.(And FYI, Turtle tastes like beef.)For my entree I got the Chicken Clemenceau. It was good, definitely better than most chicken dishes. But I wasn't exactly floored by it. The brabant potatoes and red beans that came with it were outstanding though. Even though the chicken wasn't my favorite chicken ever, it was nice and moist, and the pieces with skin still on them were very flavorful and loaded with different seasonings.The bf got the Creole Spiced Fillet of Beef for his main dish, which definitely won the award for best entree. It was a hearty cut of beef that was also seasoned beautifully.For dessert we both got the much-raved about Bananas Foster. We agreed that this was the star player for the evening. Your server sets up a little station and flambés it up table-side. And let me tell you, it is quite the production, Benihana style. Flames abound, sparks fly, and the server makes a volcano out of onions and fake-squirts you with mustard! Okay, not that last part. It really is a spectacle though. And the taste? WOW. The bananas! The brown sugar! The ice cream! Just perfect.So yes, the food was great. All that said though, I have to admit we were very disappointed in the service. The waitstaff were all incredibly nice, but we were completely rushed through our whole meal. We didn't get our bottle of wine until halfway through our soup because it came out so quickly, and as soon as we were done with our soup, we were given our entrees. By the time the meal was done, we'd only finished half our bottle of wine, and it's not because we were sipping our wine at a turtle's pace (pun absolutely intended).I don't know if it's because we were dining off of the Restaurant Weeks menu or what, but we were completely rushed through our meal, as though they needed us out as soon as possible. I knew I wasn't being unfair when my laid-back, low-maintenance bf said something about it to me before I even had voiced the thought to him. When eating at a fine dining, white-tableclothed restaurant, I would expect it to be a longer, more enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, I must say the way we were rushed really did put a damper on the occasion.So far, while I like the idea of Houston Restaurant Weeks, my two dining experiences with it have been sub-par mixed bags.Ugh, but now I've got a Benihana craving like you wouldn't BELIEVE.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=200,Donnie E.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,18,2,,7/29/15,"Fine dining, but comfort.It feels like home but with wonderful service and food.

I gotta live the high life more often.Anyway we sit down, and I think etiquette is to allow the waiter to place the napkin on your lap, which I will forever think is weird. But whatever, I let him do his thing. We're a party of 10 asians so we say a succinct, ""No, that's okay"" when he asks whether we want any wine or iced tea. Great start, team.For a second I entertain the idea of ordering off the regular menu, but then I regain focus. I head back to the Restaurant Week menu: Turtle Soup, Filet of Beef, and Bananas Foster. Then I throw our waiter a bone and get myself some wine (treat yo' self).Turtle Soup comes out and I go at it. For the first 2/3 of the way, I don't even realize I'm not eating any turtle. Apparently it's all that the bottom, so I guess now you know. Turns out turtle taste doesn't stand out all that much. I wonder if the rest of their body underneath the shell is wrinkly like the neck?Filet of Beef is served and I immediately do a size comparison with everyone else around the table. Alright, it'll pass, I got one of the larger ones. Medium rare seems like a good choice. Pretty good steak, but I really can't say all that much about it beyond that (how did I ever become Yelp Elite???). But I have a reputation to uphold among my friends, so I blurt out, ""Mmm, exquisite!""A small few of our party order the Bread Pudding instead of the Bananas Foster, so they get served first 'cause it's not like they bake it at your table side. The rest us chuckle and shake our heads, ""You idiots should have gotten the flaming bananas."" A dude rolls around his mini-stove and Benihana's our Bananas Fosters. I try the Bananas Foster and the Bread Pudding then conclude that fancy is for fools. The Bread Pudding that is baked in the kitchen where no patron can see, where the light flickers, is much better than the Bananas Foster.So that's it, really. For the amount of food I got, $35 was worth it for sure. A 3-course meal at Brennan's should cost $50 max. I guess the regular prices are there to justify the conversation you have the next day with co-workers about how you went to Brennan's.

The catfish wasn't bad, but some parts had that ""not so fresh fishy"" taste. The turtle soup wasn't bad ( I've had it before somewhere else), but nothing to rave about. My friend ordered the perdue which came with an egg sunny side up, in which she asked her's to be scrambled, but they still brought it out runny. She's pregnant, so she didn't want to take the bacteria risk. The waiter happily took the plate back to be scrambled without a problem. I also tasted her petite beignets, in which neither of us were impressed by those either. They were kind of hard, and the coffee chocolate sauce that came with it was cold. I'm pretty sure that was supposed to be served warm, but...As far as my apple empanada- again, not impressed.

For example, I ordered tea and requested raw sugar. He brought me a couple of packets, and I had to request more. He finally got the idea to just fill the sugar tray with the raw sugar packets. Plus, I had to request for him to remove items off the table because he kept bringing things to the table but never removing what we were finished with. To me, this seemed evident that we were running out of space on the table, but apparently not to this guy.Overall, I'd say the environment is cozy, and the other staff were great. The chef and manager personally came out to meet us- which was a nice touch. Maybe this was an off day- didn't read any reviews prior to (gasp I know).

It's definitely got an old-school fancy restaurant vibe, which is different from the places I normally go to.For my restaurant week dinner, I got the highly-recommended turtle soup, the creole-spiced filet, and bananas foster. Everyone I talked to recommended the turtle soup, and it was a good pick. It's almost a grown-up tomato soup. You've got the tart tomato flavor mixed with some herbs and seafood. Honestly, I wouldn't even know it was turtle if it wasn't in the name. Friends also try the soup du jour, which was a seafood corn bisque - that was absolutely phenomenal. Don't be afraid to stray away from the usual recommendations, because that was fantastic.Creole spiced filet was definitely the highlight though. I've only had filet a few times, but this one takes the cake. It was a perfect medium rare and required no pressure from the knife to slice through. It was beautiful. Great flavoring too!Once again, the bananas foster came recommended. It's a great little show as they flambe them tableside, but I actually preferred the bread pudding. It had the consistency of a glutinous oatmeal, but it was delicious. The bananas fosters would have been better if cooked longer - the alcohol taste was still pretty prevalent. Overall a good experience.

I have always wanted to dine at this table and can't quote afford the Chef-for-a-Day experience yet, so this was a welcomed treat and I was thrilled to be invited. Our reservation was for 12, which is the maximum number of people who can be seated at the Kitchen Table (minimum is 4). We kicked off the celebration at the bar and then were escorted to our table promptly at 7:30. One of Brennan's two sommeliers, whose name I can't recall :-/, explained that he would be our server for the evening and asked who would be opting for wine pairings (all 12 of us said yes). Throughout the night he was very friendly and funny, answering all our dumb questions without condescension, and helped make the evening very relaxed and enjoyable for us all. Before the meal, Chef Danny Trace introduced himself and asked if any of us had any food allergies or dietary preferences. Most of us will eat anything, but a few offered up some requirements and Brennan's was happy to accommodate.A couple of short minutes later we were served the first course, and the meal was paced very well from then on out. Each portion was relatively large compared to what I've received during other tasting events, but I can't say I'm surprised since I never leave Brennan's hungry. I licked all my plates clean and even stole a few bites from my pescatarian friend to my right (the crawfish & waffle - YUMMM). I appreciated that each course was served to all 12 of us at the exact same time by multiple servers, and I swear by the end of the night we had been served by everyone in the kitchen. Each dish and accompanying wine were explained well and paired very nicely together. For dessert, we were served at least 1 of everything on the dessert menu, and played dessert roulette passing all the items around. It was a wonderful end to the meal.As much food as we were served, I left comfortably full (if that makes sense?!) at the end of the evening and didn't feel like I had to be rolled out of there afterward. I definitely grabbed a few pralines on my way out, which I'm now consuming for breakfast...As for price, each couple's bill totaled just under $350, not including tip (without wine pairings it would have been under $200). It was definitely worth the price tag, though next time I would probably purchase wine by the bottle or individual glass as I prefer heavy reds and we were served whites, rose and lighter-bodied reds. That is just my personal preference, though, and just something to consider for next time. Can't wait for the next big family celebration, holiday, milestone, etc. so I can come back again!","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=240,Jessica K.,"Hillsdale, NJ",21,349,53,,2/12/13,"Dinner here is an experience. I didn't find out until our meal was completely done & paid for, they filmed one of the date scenes between Shirley Maclaine & Jack Nicholson in the 1983 Oscar winning film, Terms of Endearment.

I'm not sure if it was the EXACT table, but they've kept all the décor the same.Brennan's was impressive, our party felt a tad under-dressed since there were a lot of suits & dresses quietly chatting over there gazillion dollar bottles of wine. So just remember that if you dress up, you'll probably feel better than going dressed down.For one of their desserts called the ""Bananas foster"" the presentation is half the reason people order it. At tableside they throw brown sugar & cinnamon in a pan, and then the bananas are sautéed until it all melts. Once that's all hot they add rum and it all goes on FIRE. For my meal I ate duck, rice & quail egg. I feel like a failed foodie because I didn't really enjoy it all that much. But hey, ya gotta try it to not like it, right? However, the garlic & eggplant soup was amazing. It may not be a regular soup on their menu, but I wouldn't hesitate to try any of them.Last but not least, their service was amazing. Our server was funny and got along well with our party of five. When we asked to see parts of the other dining areas another waiter proceeded to give us a random tour of the place. It's huge!

The seared ahi was pepper crusted and perfectly seared, very tasty reduction drizzled over it and a wasabi sauce on the side that was just right. The crab cakes were a lump crab and had very little if any filler like so often happens, topped with even more lump crab and a very light sauce over the top, by far one of the best crab cakes I have had outside of Maryland.Next we shared a BLT Wedge salad that had just enough of all the right toppings, bacon, blue cheese and tomatoes to make it a great segway to our main course.Food was a solid 4+ and the ambiance was classic up scale steak and seafood restaurant, with the people dressed from casual casual to very nice in suits and dresses.

As a Houston native who has adopted New Orleans as a second home, there is simply no other option when you're yearning for some NOLA comfort, both in food and in service. Running my usual 5 minutes late, I called ahead and they graciously accommodated our party of 4. Who says chivalry is dead? Not here, my friend.Pro-tip: Watch carefully for the quaint little green awning - it can sneak up on you. Arriving at our appointed (belated) time, the parking attendants quickly assisted the ladies exiting and we happily turned over the truck and (mostly me) practically leaped up the red brick steps to the french doors. Immediately greeted with smiles all around, we were quickly escorted to a lovely window table surrounded by overstuffed chairs the color of butter. (Decor Pro-tip: These beautiful chairs can be found at High Fashion Home) Greeted by our server Lilly, she solicited our cocktail orders: French 75 and Pimm's cups all around! When in Rome...Now, let me break here to explain that Brennan's BURNT DOWN in 2010. That's right, this lovely little home is actually rebuilt form the bottom up to be exactly as you remembered - it's like they knew if they changed a single thing it would break our little hearts. I can still remember watching the evening news of Brennan's burning and my subsequent sobs of ""Save the turtle soup!"" Thankfully, this little slice of heaven is right back as it should be.At this point its helpful to note some sage advice from a New Orleans resident I received: Old favorites are more fun with a neophyte. And luckily, we had our very own - so I was thrilled to explain how the menu changes seasonally and the entrees include a starter AND dessert automatically, as nature intended. Houston may believe that a meal consists of one plate, but New Orleans folks know that a meal is at minimum 3 courses and always, always includes dessert. Cocktails now arrived (seriously, why are there not more places in Houston that serve a Pimm's cup?!?), I note mine is perfectly balanced with the traditional cucumber slice garnish. The table agrees: the perfect summer cocktail, refreshing and tasty without being overly sweet. We are also treated to the lovely sweet & savory bread combo: a cheddar & bacon biscuit so fluffy I swear my grandma's back there baking 'em up, and a sweet cinnamon muffin with brown sugar streusel perfectly crusted on top. More bread is practically sung from the table as soon as they're devoured...Lilly passes round the menus and described the chef's specials and recommendations for the day in delicious detail. Service is not simply a standard here, it is a goal to which all restaurants should aspire - no one can make you feel more at home than the staff at Brennan's. We hem and haw, especially me, trying to decide between old favorites and new offerings. Finally, I do the most sensible thing: I solicit recommendations. And Lilly is correct - the turtle soup will always be here for me, so why not try the escargot crepe? I wisely take her advice and follow it with the pecan crusted catfish over french beans. My crepe arrives stuffed to the brim with large escargot and covered in a delicate meuniere sauce, full of bold flavor and hints of a dark roux. The crepe is surprisingly flaky given the sauce and is the perfect compliment to the large escargot. At this point, I'm patting myself on the back for my choice when Lilly arrives with a demitasse cup of turtle soup, because ""We can't let you leave here without a taste of turtle soup."" See what I mean? This is the kind of service that makes me want to become a regular. And oh, the turtle soup was, as always, perfection in a bowl. Full herb flavor in a creamy dark roux sauce covering small bite sized pieces, it is simply divine. Next up, my pecan crusted catfish arrives beautifully brown and perfectly covered in chopped pecan pieces. It is so perfectly smothered in pecans I want to ask Chef how he does it. The pecans are slightly sweet and juicy, mixing well with the fresh white flaky catch. Crisp and fresh french beans and slivered almonds are the perfect compliment, and could almost convince you that this dish is ""healthy"" if I didn't know how much butter was involved in its preparation. But c'est la vie, it's my birthday right? I'm barely able to finish half and the ever so lovely Lilly offers to box up the rest, sadly I have to decline as we're headed to the theatre for a matinee of Book of Mormon. But not until after dessert...Pro-tip: Brennan's has a shuttle for the Theatre District and will take you from their lovely dining room right to your show and back again. The best part? You can defer dessert and coffee until you return.Sadly, dessert and coffee will have to wait for another review as I've reached my character limit...","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=280,Derek R.,"Galleria/Uptown, Houston, TX",0,7,2,,5/16/15,"Hostess was dismissive and surly.

I've been here before several times at 2 ish and this Gestapo attitude is new or personal. We were in one of the side street view 'booths' with uncomfortable high back chairs and limited views because of the 'wings' on the high backs. The backs of the chairs are hard on your back because of the upright flat shape, but the really do look good!! And the chairs are so heavy they are hard to pull up to the table to dine when the time comes. Next visit, if there ever is one, I will ask for a regular table with standard chairs. My catfish was good, crusted and baked, not grilled as the waiter advised. My half cup of cauliflower soup was very tasty. My wife got the vegetarian thing, and she said it was just so-so, and that Brennan's have 'lost the plot'. Her spinach or collard greens thing, or whatever it was, was so salty it wasn't edible so it was sent back. The waiter came back and said they were having a conference in the kitchen about the salt. No replacement was brought nor offered. Obviously our waiter wanted to hurry up and get off work or start setting up for dinner. Ok Brennan's I understand that you have a schedule to maintain but why not consider NOT allowing reservations past 1pm if 2pm is really a drop dead time.

I also like how our servers were always amicable and accessible. Brunch here comprise of 3 course: Soup/Salad, entree and dessert. I ordered the turtle soup, crabcake benedict, and bananas foster. My soup came out, and after a good splash of sherry... the spicy aroma of the roux (had a lovely dark brown hue) nearly lifted me out of my seat. One taste of the soup and I noticed it wasn't the same. It was good, but not the same stock. After researching around on the net, I found out they use veal stock. Hmmm *shrug* Meat was finely minced, texture was like that of minced clams.The poached egg on my benedict was flawless. When I digged my fork into it, the yolk gorgeously ran across my crabcake. The hollandaise and egg yolk permeated everything. The crabcake was dense and filled with gulf coast crab meat. The mushrooms and reduction accompanying the dish brought in rich bold flavors to the dish. No meal would be complete without their staple, the bananas foster. It's done table side on a small gueridon table. The waiters play a prominent role to this dessert. She flambéed this sucker with such gusto that it became even more irresistible. Bananas cut lengthwise with notes of brown sugar, cinnamon, banana liqueur and an extra splash of rum... THANK YOU! The hot brown sugar intermixed with the cold melted ice cream was tantalizing. After all these decades... it's still da bomb!!!Somehow, Sunday Brunch and live jazz music go hand in hand. It just starts the day off right.

The whole place is just lovely. We had a group of about 17 people and we only had two servers. They did their best. But there were two of them and so many of us. My water glass was never refilled. At one point I had to get up and get my own glass of wine. There was hair in my salad (I didn't tell them which was my fault but I didn't want to make a scene). Our brunch dishes took a WEIRDLY long time between deliveries. Like 20 minutes. No lie. I was totally finished by the time my neighbors got their food. And I had the steak and eggs and they had pancakes!Which brings me to my food. I had the filet and eggs. The filet was...pathetic. Decent piece of meat, destroyed in the kitchen. It was inedible. I even asked for rare. It was so chewy I had three bites and gave up. It came with mashed potatoes that had a cloyingly sweet flavor and were totally off putting. And an over easy egg that had far too much raw egg white. The place is crazy busy, I get that. But seriously? It was bad. Husband said the same about his steak. He ate both of ours because he was apparently starving, but said it was disappointing. Now note we did not send anything back, nor did we complain, nor did we ask got anything to be removed from the bill. We just ate (or tried to eat) what was served and left it at that.The dessert was great. Pecan pie. That was TASTY!!!! That alone deserves stars. Overall it was mediocre.

I was very upset and told the lady to please suggest to management for those of us that want to be fans, but haven't been there yet, to put all the necessary holiday information on the website. She snickered pretentiously and said ""Sure. I'll tell them you think they should do that"". Based on this call alone, I probably don't want to go to Brennan's. She wasn't very customer friendly. It was that generic, fake ""empathy"" they try to pass as understanding, when they are really rolling their eyes and already planning to get a good laugh out of it later with their co-workers.  For those of you who might be looking, there is NO information on Brennan's, that I found, that suggests you can't use the online tool for any reservation. If this is standard behavior, I have no experience with it. I will probably not be going to Brennan's. Not this year. Especially not for Valentine's.

From the beautiful decor, to the impeccably dressed and diligent waiters - come here for great food, great service, and GREAT pecan pralines. They call it ""creole fine dining."" My husband spent 7 years in New Orleans and he loves how it feels so much like beloved NOLA. $5 Valet. Don't forget a pecan praline on your way out (they are toppling over on a large tray near the door). Try not to stuff too many in your pocket. Food: The menu is constantly changing. The turtle soup is always a good bet and always on the menu. Careful about adding too much sherry, because it can overpower the soup. The poblano soup is also good and flavorful, as they literally blend the tortillas into the soup. It is a soup du jour, so you may not see it. There is always a three course menu on the side that is a good deal, appetizer, select entrees and dessert. My husband normally gets the pre fixe menu, I get an appetizer and entree and we split the dessert. The Gulf Coast Shrimp Chippewa is delicious if you like shrimp and the presentation is wonderful. They cook it right beside your table. The Bread Pudding is a must for taste and the Bananas Foster, while not my favorite because I don't like bananas, has a great presentation too, at table side. Who doesn't want a side of flames with their dessert. Service: Brennan's prides itself on impeccable service and they deliver. Even the valet guys are top notch. Ambiance: Beautiful southern decor, with large luxurious chairs. The dress code is business casual and men should wear a jacket for dinner if you want to sit in the main dining room.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=300,Humaira R.,"Lorton, VA",4,17,,,3/8/15,Excellent Cajun restaurant in Houston.

There are only a handful of restaurants that can do it as well as Brennan's does! If you want a 5 star dining experience, then make your way to Brennan's to dine in elegance.Upon arrival, you will be greeted by the friendly valet staff who promptly open doors and are quick to assist anyone needing help. Don't even think about parking your own car as valet is a must at this restaurant. Once you walk in, you are then greeted by the friendly hostess staff. Even if you don't have a reservation, they will do their best to accommodate you, but do your best to always be prepared with reservations here since this is an upscale formal dining experience.There are two dining rooms to choose from, as well as an upstairs dining area. In addition to these areas where men are required to wear a jacket to dine, there is a great bar area and an outdoor patio area. The outdoor area is frequently reserved by parties or being utilized by smokers, so double check before requesting to be seated outside.The bar inside of Brennan's is both trendy and elegant with bartender's that are able to serve up any type of cocktail your heart desires as well as being able to guide you through the wine list. Arrive early to enjoy a cocktail before dinner in this lively and unique restaurant bar.No matter what you request or ask of the staff, they are more than quick to accommodate any and every need that you may have during your dining experience. I've tried a little bit of everything off of the menu, including having Sunday Brunch here. I have no complaints about any of the food, but I do have to say that I am not a fan of the turtle soup. It's not the turtle, it's the flavor of the soup. I had heard plenty of people rave about the turtle soup and I was under the impression that it was a bisque style soup, but when I ate it, I wasn't too crazy about the roux based soup. Everyone else seems to love it, so decide for yourself with a small cup of it. One of my absolute favorites on the menu is the fresh gulf fish that is prepared with traditional creole sauces and seasonings that have a unique blend of French and Cajun foods. The fish, for the most part, is seasonal, so you are sure to get the freshest fish possible from the Gulf.Save room for the amazing desserts with the bananas foster being prepared table side. All of the desserts are amazing, but if you decide to eat their featured dessert, order one and split it between two people as it is more than one person needs for dessert.Whether you are visiting here for a special occasion, Sunday Brunch, or just because, you will never be disappointed on any level with this exceptional addition to outstanding Houston restaurants.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=320,Alison H.,"Los Angeles, CA",152,257,38,,3/14/13,"I think that the fact that they give you freaking awesome Pralines rather than mints or what have you at the end of the meal upped them one star, because for the price the food is good but not blow your mind in orgasmic pleasure good.The BF and I were able to make it into the fancy section so really dressing up is worth the comfy chairs, you do really feel at home and I can't fault them for the ambiance.

The food was good, but the service was lacking. We had a wait time of about 20-30 minutes between each course and during those times, we didn't even see our waiter. We had to flag down other wait staff to get things such as refills on our drinks. One would think that with such a small menu, the kitchen and staff would have it better timed than that. At minimum, if the wait was going to be so long, they should provide you more than with two small pieces of bread to stop your stomach from grumbling while you wait 25 minutes for your appetizer. After our entree, we waited even longer. Another person on the wait staff noticed us sitting there with finished plates and empty glasses and finally asked to clear the table. When he asked, I made the comment that we had been ""done for a while now"", and after that the coffee service and dessert was prompt. To make up for the poor service, I do have to say that the food was good (once it arrived). We had the Quail and Waffles as an appetizer- It was good, but a bit strange combination. I have never been a fan of the meat and waffle combo- that was my fiancé's choice. For our Entrees, I had the Gumbo and he had the Lamb Chops. Everything tasted great. The gumbo was excellent! For dessert (since he is not a fan of Bananas Foster) we had the Creole Bread pudding. It was good too, but by that time I we were so full that we could barely get through half of it. Overall, I don't think that I will be going back.

Our group of 10 got a large round table, but one of the chairs was smashed up against the wall. The person who sat there was quite small, but we still had to pull the table out for her to get in. That's not what I expect at a place of this caliber. Second, I had to request quite a few things such as a black napkin. when it was brought, other people had to ask for the same. I ordered a diet coke while everyone else had wine. I had to ask for it 20 minutes later to the chagrin of the waitress. While we were there we heard a huge crash come from the kitchen, which honestly sounded like at least 20+ plates hitting the floor. So, our first impressions weren't great. We had a 7pm reservation and were all sitting by 7:15pm. We ordered wine but didn't get to order our food until 8pm. We aren't sure why everything moves quite so slowly at Brennan's. We expected to have a leisurely dinner, but it all just took too long.The best part of my meal was the little garlic bread pieces they bring out before dinner. We ate those quickly as we were all hungry and had hoped they would bring some more. They didn't. When we asked for bread, they brought us yummy warm french rolls wrapped up in napkins that they just placed on the table. They didn't have a bread dish or anything. It was really quite odd.The food: I started with the crawfish and tomato bisque which was over seasoned. My friends had the salads and turtle soup. The turtle soup was a favorite. I had the soft shelled crab as an entree and it was just ok. It had too much breading and the sauce was too acidic. Other people all liked their food but no one raved about it, which is unusual for the group I was with. Everyone was curious about everyone else's food, so we tried quite a few dishes each. No one was wowed. It was just all mediocre. Dessert: Everyone at our large table got a dessert. I got the bananas foster which is made table side. By the time she served it, it was bananas foster soup (see photo). It had a nice flavor, but it was soup! 4 people at our table got bananas foster and it was served the same way to each.

When I got the bill found out it was not. So I am a bit peeved about that. The food overall - turtle soup was okay. Sherry was too strong with the soup, and not the best I have had. Got the steak, and it was okay. I have had much much better steaks. Sauce was good though. Then I had the banana fosters and was really excited about it, but it was probably the worst banana fosters I have ever had. First they decided to cook everyone's together, so when you are making 5+ orders you need to adjust how you cook it. So the cooking time wasn't enough, so the bananas were not soft at all. I am not sure if they were even really ripe. Then due to the amount of alcohol and flames, when they attempted to put cinnamon on it, it would just burn up. So not much in the way of cinnamon. So, food was okay, but not worth the price paid for it. Much rather go to a better restaurant when wanting to eat somewhere nice.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=320,Eric L.,"Houston, TX",64,153,14,,8/29/12,"I came here for restaurant week last night and MAN what a treat.First and foremost, you must valet when coming to Brennan's.

Once inside we were met by the hostess and sure enough the reservation was in place and we were seated instantly no wait at the bar, no hold on, no excuses.

I decided on Monday night, because I thought they would have some of the opening night bumps, well behind them. I heard that the fire alarm went off several times on Friday night, then the music and lighting was on the fritz downstairs on Sunday night. Monday was PURRRRRFECT. I decided to take one of my best friends because we always have such a good time at their sister restaurant, Commander's Palace in New Orleans. We arrived a little early and had a chance to look around a bit downstairs. The dining rooms are fantastic. Modern, Classy with great furniture and ambiance. I am told the Chef's table in the kitchen isnt ready, but that just gives you another reason to come back in a few months, as if the food wasnt enough reason already. I particularly liked one of the side rooms that had its own fireplace. The bar is quaint, but the fact it leads to the gorgeous courtyard is the real bonus. Upstairs, its obvious they have a special event/banquet room on the outside wall but the dining rooms inside over look the courtyard. From the carpet to the drapes the place is beautiful. This is not your grandparents Brennans, however, they would be very comfortable here too. We partook in the complimentary wine, but Felix, one of three Somoliers, let us take a peek at a fantastic wine list. Great selection of Cabs, Pinot, Rhone, Burgundy, etc. I noticed that the selections were certainly on the high side but many of the offerings were single vineyard, so the quality should match the price. Having said that there are several very affordable selections including their small but bold choices for Zinfandel.Now on to the food. Its just not Brennan's without starting with turtle soup. Nothing has changed here. Generous bowl that is as consistent as ever. The Chef's Playground, a selection of home made sausage, venison and other meats was a tasty twist for an appetizer. Certainly reminds of the boucherie that can be found at traditional cajun restaurants. For those of you who love bread, there is an artisan selection at the table in addition to some melt in your mouth cheese toast.Our dinner selections for the evening were Redfish topped with jumbo lump crabmeat and a filet of beef. These two dishes were incredible. Right temperature, sauce and accompaniment of potatoe, either mashed or au gratin galette. The cream of spinach was frankly very average, but it was just a distraction anyway. Dessert was a table cooked banannas foster that was incredibly sweet with the right combination of warm outside and chilled inside. Yummy cinnamon and liquer glaze.The staff was very professional, friendly but probably need a few more weeks to get everything down including the menu items, after they have tasted them personally. Did I say this place is beautiful? Whether a special occasion or a great business lunch or dinner, this place shouldnt dissapoint.

Between the delightful New Orleans Brennan's and this one, I think I actually prefer Houston's take.Brennan's of Houston excels at service and cuisine.

This time of year I order butternut squash soup with reckless abandon, and was thrilled to see that Brennan's had their own take on the ubiquitous fall bisque. Brennan's version brought a bit of spice to the mix, with a hit of pepitas and smokiness. It was probably the best version I've ever tasted, let alone the most memorable.For my entree, I ordered the pecan-encrusted mahi mahi.

The gumbo was really fantastic, it had that oceanic seafood stock taste that I really crave in a gumbo. We ordered the quail with waffle. An elegant twist to a soul food classic.

The food was delicious. We had a party of 15 and a set menu, starting with a turtle soup and a vinaigrette salad. The soup was spicy, but tasty. The salad's dressing was slightly sweet, just right. Our choice of entrees were a pecan crusted gulf fish, truffled chicken, and beef tenderloin. I chose the beef, which arrived with mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms. It was wonderful! Luckily I had asked for a to-go box as soon as the entrees arrived. I was so stuffed, even after eating half of the entree! Dessert was bananas foster. I thought it was really sweet (as typical of this dessert). Someone commented the dessert was not as good as usual, but I didn't know any differently.Also note before dinner, I started at the bar. The long island was pricey ($10), but delicious. I probably could've easily drank three of them because they were so yummy. The bartender was also funny.I docked a star for service. I expect top of the line service at such a restaurant, but there were certain idiosyncrasies that I found odd. The two servers kept the door open most of the time, and they didn't bother lowering their voices while talking during a presentation. They also did not follow the traditional standard of serving females at the table first. The table setting lacked a butter knife (so I had to use my knife for both butter and beef), steak knife (which would've been useful for the beef), and soup spoon. I would've thought such a restaurant would be able to properly set a table. We had to ask for bread twice. For some reason, the servers put two loaves of bread between four people, and one loaf of bread between seven people. I found this strange.Despite the shortcomings, I would definitely return again!","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=360,Shannon O.,"Austin, TX",103,282,408,Elite ’17,12/20/13,"The ambiance was great...and the service was very professional and attentive.

We were impressed from start to finish..Our server Kelley and his assistant Julio were hands down one of the best server teams either me or my wife have ever had pleasure of being served by.. The food and drink were also tremendous.. To start off the chef sent out an amuse-bouche of citrus shrimp, which tasted bright, light and well rounded. The citrus and sauce reminded me of summer, but this was January.. For an app we had the truffle stew which was honestly one of my favorite stews of all time.. The selection of mushrooms were impressive and the flavors were nicely built, very deep and not overly seasoned. This was a great winter app, but very versatile IMO.. This app could show up on a spring or summer menu and I would order it again in a heartbeat..We had the three apple salad with a spectacular cider emulsion which was spot on this time, the cheese was a perfect complement to the apples.. The added brittle is a fun addition and interesting, but I never picked up any of the Tabasco flavors in it.. However, this is still my favorite salad at Brennans, with the apples and the pecans it reminds me of a fun spin on the Waldorf. Soups were stellar, my favorite was the turtle which Kelly didn't over do it on adding the sherry to table side.. My wife enjoyed the cauliflower soup more than the turtle or the gumbo. I'm not a big gumbo fan in general, but this was my first time trying Brennan's and I have to say I was impressed. The gumbo was very well done IMO..Mains were phenomenal, we had the osso buco which was cooked to perfection and very well balanced. The mushroom rice was IMO perfect, but some might like it a bit more al-dente when cooking risotto. My favorite thing on this dish was the fried oysters and horseradish cream sauce, it had Emeril written all over it.. I could eat these things by the plate full. We also had the beef filet which had improved leaps and bounds over the last time we were here.. The reduction was delicious and bursting with vivid flavor that complemented the beef and mushrooms perfectly. However the potatoes tasted a bit under seasoned and one dimensional, but nothing that detracted from the overall dish..The fromage seems to have evolved quite a bit from the last time we tried it. We loved the jam and fruit gelatin additions to the cheese plate and the honeycomb is always good. A+ on the cheese plate, I highly recommend it to cheese lovers. The chef did a great job of selecting the cheeses for us and gave us a wide rage of profiles and flavors. Our proper desserts were both solid as well, we had the bread pudding soufflé and the white and dark chocolate mousse cake. The pulled sugar and chocolate topper were a nice touch to the cake along with the flavored salt. The flavors and texture of the soufflé were solid and it was baked to perfection.You know when you have one of those special meals that will always stick in your memory as perfect and helps define the benchmark for other dinning? Well this dinner was one of those..

I didn't even know it was back until a couple of months ago. So I was pretty excited to check it out. The decor is my taste; I love the brick and the deep cream seats that are difficult to stand up from. I give it a 3, however, because I don't think the service and food was where it should have been for a restaurant that is so lauded.When I visited this past week, there were not that many people in the dining room, so I raised an eyebrow when the waitstaff put a meal in front of me and my companion when we hadn't even ordered. Not a big deal, however. What caused the downgrade was the fact that they got my steak wrong. My companion and I got the same thing, the special of the night, which was a filet with jumbo lump crab meat, mash potatoes, asparagus covered in bernaise sauce. When she ordered medium rare and I ordered medium, I knew enough to confirm with our waiter that he was sure he was giving me medium. He confirmed. What I got was a half rare steak, so not even medium rare; I couldn't even cut through it (not that I was going to eat rare steak). To the restaurant's and the waiter's credit, he apologized and our desserts were comped. And from what I was able to eat of the dinner, it was delicious. But if you say you do steak, I think you should do it properly.In other news, they have a pretty interesting wine list. And I'd give Brennan's another shot.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=380,James M.,"Houston, TX",0,40,,,5/14/12,"I've been to Brennan's twice for brunch since it has reopened after that devastating fire.

This is a perfect celebratory restaurant - as they take care of everything starting with setting the mood.... Come to Brennan's expecting the highest class in service, without feeling like you have to point your nose in the air (you are getting a taste of NOLA after all). I was welcomed to the restaurant for SUNDAY BRUNCH by the nicest staff of valet drivers EVER and was seated immediately due to our reservation. The meal kicked off with complimentary, ""fresh from the oven"" muffins and biscuits (I preferred the fluffy biscuit). I enjoyed my light bites as I perused the ""how do you choose - it all looks so good"" menu. When I dine for celebratory purpose, I don't mind splurging a little. You definitely get the best bang for your buck splurging at Brennan's for brunch. You can't walk out of here for less than $50 per person but you WILL walk out with a FULL and satisfied belly. Their brunch menu is typically 3 courses of your choice: starter, entree and dessert (including tableside banana's foster!) averaging at $35 a meal (plus tax, tip, and a libation if you like to party at brunch like me). Don't be cynical, my fair yelper - each course is of the up-most quality AND quantity - TRUST. The starters ranged from soups, salads and other NOLA inspired apps. Seeing as though I have commitment issues when it comes to food, I highly recommend the ""1-1-1"" which is a sampling of every soup on their menu including their famous Turtle Soup. My brother has claimed to almost drive to NOLA for this soup alone before Brennan's reopened post fire. The turtle soup was delicious and surprisingly reminiscent of a great fire roasted tortilla soup, however I prefered the creamy corn and crab soup. Gumbo was featured as the third soup, which was also fabulous (even though I'm not generally a gumbo gal). Overall, the trio of soup (served in 3 miniature tea cups) was excellent without being overwhelming. Good luck picking an entree - as they ALL read AMAZING. I finally selected the craw-fish cakes with poached eggs as this seemed the most unique. The dish was served on a bed of chopped sausage and roasted sliced peppers with two cakes (think crab cakes made of craw-fish instead) topped with the most perfectly poached eggs. I wish I took video of me cutting into the poached eggs and watching the yolk dance (yes dance) so elegantly over the cakes. Meanwhile the craw-fish cakes were crispy on the outside and moist, meaty and savory on the inside - a pleasure (although I could only eat half). I also tasted my mom's shrimp and grits which were awesome and my brother's gulf coast fish encrusted with pecans - perfection. I wanted to try the blue crab scramble with caviar and their egg's benedict dishes that kept appearing at neighboring tables-excellent. I can't believe I have not even started on the service - what really takes Brennan's to 5 stars - they treat you like royalty. Prime example: when our 5 entrees came out, 5 waiters brought each plate out to us simultaneously. Meanwhile, a NOLA style quartet complete with horns would walk around the dining room playing jazz for the guests - did I wake up in the French Quarter? There are a number of STUNNING dining rooms to be seated in, each unique with its own decor and design. My table happened to be in the front room to the left donning hard woods, brick walls, dramatic curtains hung around HUGE windows and the most comfortable / plush and gorgeous chairs. I would sleep in this room if I could - BEAUTIFUL. I hope everyone reading this has a chance to be Brennan's guest for brunch - a delightful experience. Don't run out to the valet (yes it's mandatory - but what's another $5 when you are swanking it up already) before picking up a few pralines by the door ""for someone else"". You will get that joke when you read the napkin you fold your pralines in..... ....so make your reservation and go already! You can always find an excuse to celebrate - like reading my 100th review!","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=380,Chris K.,"Oak Forest/Garden Oaks, Houston, TX",31,123,199,,8/14/13,"Absolutely one of the best restaurants in the South!

My parents had gone a few years back with a local attorney and raved about the turtle soup, the super thin creme brulee, and the great atmosphere.Fast forward a few years, the restaurant burning down, the grand re-opening, and I finally make reservations to have dinner with my parents.I started with the 1-1-1 soup which was a taste of all three soups. The turtle soup was...good. It was not bad, but it was just good. The gumbo was mediocre and the best soup was a jalapeno cheese one. Yum.For the entree I got a crawfish jambalaya type dish. It was edible. I didn't enjoy the flavor that much, perhaps I'm just not a cajun creole at heart. My parents didn't seem too happy with their duck or quail entrees either.So being disappointed so far, I was hopeful the dessert would save the night. My mom had described a creme brulee served in a very thin dish so you got plenty of the caramelized sugar top. What I was served was a creme brulee served on a plate (read too thin and inconsistent depth) with a large over caramelized sugar top. The sugar top, which I expect crunchy and to brake off into flakes, was crumbly. It seemed like the sugar they used had crystals too large. It became mushy in my mouth and I was not pleased.Perhaps it was an off night or I had built it up too much, but I've truly experienced better.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=380,Richard Y.,"Houston, TX",13,5,1,,6/19/10,"I brought my 67 year-old father and the rest of my family to Brennan's for an early Father's Day... I have to say that the meal and everything was great... in fact, if it weren't for the valet parking I would have given it a 5-star rating.When I pulled up, I asked where the self-parking area was - I was told there was no self-parking option available. I find this an incredibly obnoxious thing - its really ridiculous to be forced to use valet parking, and then have to pay $5 to have someone park my car some half-block down the street when I'm perfectly capable and willing to do it myself. Furthermore - the valets won't take any responsibility to damage, theft, or vandalism to my vehicle - whats the point? That's not a feature - its a disaster waiting to happen. Without any choice, I reluctantly relinquished the keys to my vehicle and had a fantastic meal.Upon receiving my vehicle - it was clear that whoever parked it decided to hang out in my car and enjoy my stereo... radio settings were all adjusted differently than I had it... the bass was cranked up, the treble was tweaked - and the volume was obnoxiously turned up and playing a track that I would never have been playing with my elderly parents in my car. For all I know they cruised around in it while I was eating.To Brennan's - make a self-park option available... charge me $5 to park it myself if you have to... but don't force me to relinquish the keys of my fancy new car to a bunch of valets who have no respect for other's property.

Although sat in a crowded table, we ask to move to one of the larger corner tables with high-back chairs and are promptly accommodated.Our waiter is excellent throughout the evening, particularly considering that we have a late reservation. His only fault is that our wine arrives after our appetizers and our food arrives a bit too soon after that. He does, however, offer to send the food back.My boyfriend began with the classic turtle soup, not too heavy on, but with the distinct taste of sherry. His delicate soup was, however, immediately overpowered by the fine carnivorous artist's palette placed before me. Playfully titled ""Chef's Playground,"" the array of terrines and sausages was by far one of the most delightful, flavorful and yes, I'll venture to say it, 'bargain' dishes I have had state-side in years. The venison terrine melted upon my tongue, reminiscent of a veal carpacio I had at the French Laundry, and the duck confit rillette was a gorgeous spiral of flavor and texture!Deeply engrossed in this plethora of pâté, our second courses arrive - duck for him and Colorado rack of lamb for me. His duck is overwhelmingly tender and succulent, while my lamb is a perfectly crisp yet rare showcase of fine meat. Neither dish is particularly innovative, but prepared exquisitely and richly flavorful, each served with a house sausage, a slightly odd but fine accompaniment.As our meal draws to a close, the flambé cart arrives to prepare a freshly flamed bananas foster. It is a simple but delicious dessert and the tableside flames only add to the romance of the evening.Shortly thereafter, yet another dessert arrives - pralines and strawberries, ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate! We are given the classic Brennan's party chef hats and photos taken.On our way out we notice the chef at the bar and stop to thank him for a wonderful meal. Chef Trace invited us into the party immediately and offered a round of drinks. The boy ordered a Whiskey Smash while I ordered a Hemingway. Both were artfully prepared and we enjoyed sipping them while chatting with the bartender, Richard, and the Sous Chef, Javier, a native Texan and lifetime kitchen-man who enthralled us with tails of pig roasts.Although there were only three patrons left in the whole place, Richard insisted on preparing another round of Whiskey Smashes for us. A rare find in the modern bar scene, Richard is of the old school NY grand hotel bartender class who serves up the classics with perfect attention to detail and pride.We may not be able to dine at Brennan's on a regular basis, but will rush back to the bar.

There were employees eating their shift meal. The manager was sitting at the bar doing paperwork. Another employee who apparently had been off for a family thing was checking in. Everyone (mostly all employees) was just casually hanging out it seemed. Granted we came in at 9:30 or so. But, it really suited me. The restaurant is stunningly beautiful.

With as much money as people drop on a meal at this restaurant, you would think the waitstaff would offer to help.The final straw had to be when they brought my dessert and it appeared to have chocolate on it. My boyfriend said something and the waiter says ya chocolate is on it, I thought you were allergic to coconut or something.I had also ordered tea. When it arrived it was iced tea.... Who drinks iced tea with dessert? Even asking for my hot tea, twice, they still failed to bring it out.We ended up talking to the manager after that who was nice enough to have my hot tea brought out. He apologized for the situation and ended up comping the meal which surprised us... I wasn't looking for a free meal but I did want management to know his attitude was completely inexcusable for the money being spent....plus it was Father's Day. It was supposed to be a nice meal to treat my boyfriend and to see him on edge and frustrated the entire time is not the nice relaxing enjoyable idea I had in mind when I made reservations.The three stars are for the management and the food! The food was amazing..... The presentation was beautiful and the flavors perfectly paired. It could have been 5 stars had the service been even decent.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=400,connie n.,"Houston, TX",258,5,2,,8/24/14,"I never write any reviews but today I was compelled to do so. We came for brunch today for HRW. I've always heard great things about Brennan's and always wanted to check it out and was looking forward to their brunch all week! Food was good...service not so friendly.Let me first say the food was good but the service took away from my experience. As we sat down we waited for about I would say, 5 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us or at least hand us a menu. They did hand us the regular menu but what about the option the HRW menu? They brought our biscuit and muffin but no butter (I didn't realize that until I saw butter at another table next to us). Our waiter was cordial but not as inviting. He took our order and left. As our food arrived, it was delish, turtle soup was amazing and I had pouched eggs benedict, while finishing up, I noticed the table next to us, our waiter was adding fresh ground pepper to their food. Did he forget about us earlier? I then realized, how come we didn't get the same service? We didn't ask for anything out of the ordinary. I thought it can't be just coincidental. We weren't acknowledge, no refill on bread, or no butter and then the pepper. That was way to many negatives. Again, our waiter was not rude, but I felt a bit slided. I felt a bit discriminated, was it because we were Asian? I NEVER play the racial card but I can't figure out why our service was less deserving than another table next to us. I wanted to talk to a manager because I felt bad because my boyfriend doesn't want to return because of the experience. I wanted to let the manager know so that they can be more aware of what their waitstaffs are doing and why people don't return to their establishment. I was very disappointed with the experience I had today. The experience measures even more than the food sometimes...today it was a FAIL.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=400,Peter T.,"Oslo, Norway",96,250,65,,3/22/10,"Food: 3.5/5Ambiance: 3.5/5Services: 4/5Prices: $$$$ (avg 55/person)Its Friday nite and we were planning to have dinner at Straits but since I need to be in Montrose that evening, I suggested to my partner to check out Brennan's instead of driving all the way back to I10/Beltway. We got there around 8pm and of course it was fully booked. We settled on the table by the bar which was not that bad, its a bit small and no white linen but its better than sitting at the bar counter. After ordering our wine (about 20mins later), we were told that there's a table available upstairs on the enclosed balcony, we couldnt ask for a better option. I believe due to more clients coming in, they decided to open up one of the several function rooms upstairs. We were seated by the window overlooking the patio downstairs, it was great!The wait staff were very knowledgeable, friendly and welcoming. The services can be slowed for the average American diners but it was perfect for us coz we were not going anywhere. It took several mins before we got our menu and another 10 to 15mins before the waitress came back to ask if we are ready to order... We asked a few questions about the dishes on offer and some suggestions, they all seems to know whats what... So we settled on the following:Rack of Lamb (Today's Special) $39: This was indeed the star of the evening. This was also my partner's dish. You get 2 very decent size rack of lamb, lightly crusted, scrumptiously seasoned and beautifully grilled, medium rare, tender and melt in your mouth... The dish came with sides of lightly sauteed spinach & carrots. I would have snatch this dish away from my partner...Shrimp & Okra Gumbo $9: This is the roux style with about 5 pieces of medium size shrimps and rice. This gumbo is comparable to Goode Seafood, its good and better than my soup, which you will find out later... I went for the Chef's 3-course menu. The deal is you pay for the price of the entree and you get either salad or soup, the entree and a dessert. There are only 3 choices of entree, Mesquite Honey Quail $45, Boucherie (Pork tenderloin) $44, and Chardonnay Basted Grouper $46. I decided on the fish and that evening, they subs it with red fish instead of grouper. Again, well seasoned and nicely cooked, soft & flaky piece of fish atop some tagliatelle, oyster mushrooms & (i'm not so crazy & doesnt taste as fresh) al-dente green peas. In term of flavor, the lamb was better and better executed. And as for the soup, of course, i was excited to try out their famous Turtle soup, oh what a disappointment... It was salty & sour, i would prefer to chew on some turtle meat but alas, they were all blended in, so i trust that there were indeed some turtle meat in it...Now for the dessert, i saw most of the diners around ordered the Banana Foster that are prepared and served next to your table. I defied everyone recommendation and went for the Bread Pudding instead, it was spot on. I love a great soft and well mixed bread pudding with the fresh creme & strawberry.So, my conclusion, Brennan is a ""decent"" restaurant with top services but average cooking. The food were good but I didnt get the WOW effect... I dont see any other occasion that i will come back here again coz, there are just too many other restaurants in Houston that you can go for similar ambiance, services and food (maybe even better) with the same prices. My partner thought of coming back to check out the patio but again, I suggested that Backstreet Cafe has cozier patio. So, the only (maybe) but remotely possibility that I will come back is if they start to extend the menu (possibly soon according to our waitress) or someone invites me for a free dinner here...","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-houstohttps://www.yelp.com/biz/brennans-of-houston-houston?start=400,Alicia M.,"London, United Kingdom",3,61,,,8/30/13,I went during restaurant week and found the quality and cost were great. We tried the turtle soup (my first time) which was good. THe filet was delicious and the real show stopper was the Bananas Foster. They roll out a cart and cook it in front of you. This place is pretty formal which made the meal last longer than I would have preferred (over 2 hours). I'm not sure I would come back here for full price though.,"alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,brennans-of-houston-houston,brennans-of-houston-housto
