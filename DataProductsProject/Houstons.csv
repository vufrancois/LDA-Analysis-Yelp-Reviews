I've tried Mikkies, Esther Cajun cooking, Just Oxtails and I'm telling you ""This Is It "" is it, literally ! Being from Memphis I've been searching for some food that give me that down home southern taste like back home and most of the restaurants here didn't cut it until I've tried their food. We came on a Sunday and the line was to the door which was a great sign that the food would be good. Restaurant was extremely clean and in a very historic (3rd ward ) neighborhood outside of downtown Houston.My family and I ordered three plates everything from the smothered pork chops, pepper steak, and chicken was delicious. Servings were plentiful, especially for the price. I'll definitely be back there when I'm in need of some good comforting foods.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,houstons-this-is-it-soul-food-houston,houstons-this-is-it-soul-fhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/houstons-this-is-it-soul-food-houston?start=0,houstons-this-is-it-soul-food-houston,Tony K.,"Cabot, AR",2,15,3,,7/18/17,"This place appears to be a hole in the wall, looks kinda out of place. Let me tell you what!

And I must say I wasn't that impressed. Since I had never been here before, I wasn't sure how or what to order. But the server behind the counter was patient and polite and explained to us to pick three sides and a meat. There wasn't any signs or instructions. The menu posted on the wall didn't even have lunch listed from what I saw. I saw breakfast and dinner listed but no lunch. I don't remember seeing menu prices either. I decided to order macaroni and cheese, green beans and yams for my three sides. Can't go wrong there right? The sides were very good. I'll give them that. But there wasn't a lot of choices of meat to order if you don't eat beef or pork. The meats looked very unappealing to me. Thank God they had chicken! I wanted to order either chicken or catfish. The only chicken options were fried chicken or smothered chicken. So I ordered the smothered chicken. Honestly, I was hoping it was smothered in CHEESE but it was actually smothered in gravy. But to me, it was more of a thin sauce. I did get A LOT of food. Two pieces of smothered chicken and my three sides. I only ate one piece of chicken and gave the other piece to my colleague to take home. The chicken was OK but I didn't love it. I really wanted catfish. They had it listed on their menu online but there wasn't any out. The cashier was trying to get a to-go order straightened out. And it took awhile. We were standing there waiting to pay for five minutes or more. The cashier didn't say ""I'll be right with you."" or ""I apologize for the wait."" NOTHING. My colleague and I were completely ignored. That was rude. The cashier and other woman behind the counter were not friendly at all. I don't think we even got a ""Thank you"" or anything. And we definitely didn't get a smile. Very unfriendly service from the women. But the men were much nicer. By the time, we FINALLY got to the table, our food wasn't hot anymore. It was lukewarm at best. I prefer my food served HOT. For my lunch (smothered chicken breasts, green beans, mac and cheese and yams) plus a small drink, it was $13.53. My colleague ordered oxtail, three sides, a large drink and a piece of lemon cake and it was over $21! Seems a bit pricey for lunch! You get free refills for the small drinks but you have to pay for refills of the large cups. I think it was $1. One of the guys that worked there was nice and offered to get my colleague a refill of her large drink and he even paid for it. He took off 50 cents from the table which was part of his tip and then he grabbed 50 more cents from his apron. That was very kind of him!The food was OK. But honestly, I think I'd much rather go to Luby's. They have more options.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,houstons-this-is-it-soul-food-houston,houstons-this-is-it-soul-fhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/houstons-this-is-it-soul-food-houston?start=0,houstons-this-is-it-soul-food-houston,Michael Z.,"Katy, TX",63,24,2,,8/20/17,This was it..Dropped my son off at TSU and just happen to pass by.

So tender with a perfect balance of fat to elevate the flavor. You can get 3 sides when you choose a plate. I got mash potatoes with gravy and double mac and cheese.

No. Warm up that little piece of catfish the next day n it tastes like rubber. Yuck. Ick. The sides tasted about the same so I eat them. No fried chicken on sundays and aint that a damn shame for soul food spot?! On Sunday? Anyway, all the other other entrees on Sunday are smothered in gravy or something. Im not into that.

The pork chops were tender, but could have been seasoned a litte more. The yams were amazing, the macaroni and cheese just okay.

The meal also comes with 2 cornbread muffins. The portions are generous and in an ideal world, I should have had leftovers, but I am greedy. The prices are a bit on the pricier end, but I guess the portion sizes makes up for it. I thought the pork chop was a bit under seasoned, the greens were A1, the yams could have been sweeter, and the dressing was on point.I also got a peach cobbler. I had a generous portion of the crust, which is my fave so I was definitely pleased with that. The cobbler was good, but not inspirational.

So, with thinking I diddled up my handy dandy phone and went to the Yelp app. Told my mom about This Is It and she automatically knew what I was talking about. She had came to this restaurant a long time ago when she first moved to Houston to the original location. This location is on Blodgett St.This Is It parking is quite big which is inclined up hill. The entrance is very strange, you would pass right by it if your not careful. It is blinded by black tint and two doors.. the small parking lot which was filled with a taxi and city work trucks didn't help much. If you see a side door entrance.. yes. That is the entrance into This Is It. Once inside, the place looked like an old cafeteria with tables and chairs from a yeah.. cafeteria. The chairs are a little wobbly and sits low if your short at the table. At the ordering line, it is like at Luby's or Picadilly's. Just go down the ramp (if your coming from the side entrance inside) and turn left to meet up with the line. Grab a tray, some silverware, napkins, and peek over through glass to see what they are serving. The prices for meats like Ox Tails, Fried Chicken or Fish etc. is $10.50. As I approached the counter, the server asked what vegetables I wanted. Pick 3. Now, me thinking veggies are veggies. Not exactly the same as what he meant by veggies. I choose mashed potatoes and yams. One more ""vegetable""? I pointed at mac and cheese. Just about to correct him and tell him that this isn't a vegetable. But.. I left that alone. Next, to the next server he greeted me saying ""what would you like my love"". How cute.. my love he called me. I pointed at the fried chicken.. watched carefully giving him eye gestures to pick up the chicken breast over the tiny wing. He gave me a breast and the tiny wing.. man I need use my eye gestures more often I thought to myself. When we finally arrive to the register, my mom aburply said ""I don't think I have any money"". ""What?!"" Lol... she was only kiddin'. So, the atmosphere wasn't what I expecting nor my mom. The area where we sat was.. straight up ghetto! A group of women in the back did not have no respect for us, the establishment, or the other customers. They were talking outrageously loud and cursing like a sailor. Every other word was vulgar language. No one in the restaurant not even the staff or bus boy passing through cleaning up the tables said anything to them. I mean we paid our money like everyone else to try to enjoy a great outing to a new restaurant I've never visited. To experience this.. is terrible. So, come here if your in the mood to rage or cuss in public. No one will stop you.. I mean they encourage it. The food on the other hand was good not as great as Mikki's Cafe though. The Fried Chicken was the best of all. It tasted like Frenchy's chicken. Well seasoned not too overpowering or dry. Very good! The mashed potatoes were ok, nothing to fancy needed a little butter, mac and cheese the flavor was on point good, but the macroni was soggy. Everytime I would take a bite and let it sit on my tongue. It would dissolve.. literally as if it was cooked awhile ago.

And when I asked for pork chops, I got TWO of them...so I knew I was not going to be eating again for a LOOOONG time.How do you go to a soul food place and NOT ask for everything to be slathered in gravy?

It literally came apart easily as I picked it up with the fork. The servers put a nice amount of meat (not bones) inside the tray.The candid yams were a disappointment. It was all mushy and barely tasted any flavor (sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, etc.). They clearly over cooked the potatoes and need to use it for pie instead but probably did not want to waste it. Again, disappointing.Macaroni & cheese was also nothing to mention or noteworthy. It lacked flavor or seasoning. The cabbage was the best side item and next to the beef short ribs, the best item in the tray.The cornbread muffins tasted bitter.

We were given the option of ordering the kids meal (one smaller entree and two sides) even though we were not accompanied by children, which was very nice of them. The person serving us was cheerful and helpful.My friend and I were stuffed from splitting one adult plate and one dessert. The to-go box was so full that some of the sauces spilled out from the sides, making it a messy drive home.The flavors were wonderful. This is not low-calorie stuff, and I appreciated that the full-fat, generously salted food tasted as good as it was bad for me. The oxtails, bathed in a luscious, fatty gravy, were succulent and easily slid off the bone. The mac and cheese was no-frills but well-textured. The cabbage was soft and well-flavored with whatever meaty broth it was cooked in. The mashed potatoes with gravy was smooth and rich. Unfortunately, the peach cobbler was a big disappointment. It was way too sweet with none of the lovely tartness of a good peach pie derivative. The peaches tasted canned and were swimming in a cinnamon-y syrup sweeter than sweet tea, and the pastry tasted like a semi-soggy sugar cookie.We obviously visited during an unpopular time, but there appeared to be quite a bit of available lot parking.

I recommend their Mac and cheese, rice with gravy , black eyed peas, and cabbage. I'm fond of their ox tails, pig feet and chitlins' (may not be your cup of tea). The food reminds me of my aunt's and mother's cooking. But I don't like how mushy their sweet potatoes are. Everything comes with 2 cornbread muffins.

Mind you, I didn't eat at any soul food restaurants for decades. On with my review. I had rice, oxtails, cabbage, yams and a drink, along with corn bread. My wife had pretty much the same, only she had smothered chicken. She is picky about her food, and she was impressed. So was I, to an extent. The cornbread is better at Ester's soul food, so are the oxtails. The cabbage were a bit over cooked at this is it. But hey, I was hungry, and my plate was almost clean in no time.

They are super ghetto too! The manager got upset because I told him how bad each dish was that I tried! The cornbread dressing was very very salty and they had no cranberry sauce, and tasted like they had put gizzard, liver or kidney stock in it. The cabbage were bland, tasted peppery and not worth eating, the sweet potato pie had entirely too much nutmeg in it and was about 3 inches too thick! The only thing I ate was the chicken, rice and gravy and even that wasn't up to par but edible. The chicken was dry and had a little toughness to it. The waiter gave me potato salad to offset the disappointment but my first bite of that tasted very mayonaisey and mustardy, then I noticed there was a piece of hair in it. So that pretty much did it at that point. I asked to speak to the manager and he was in agreement to give me my money back for what I hadn't eaten, but then when he went so far as to say that his cook has been cooking there for 33 years and that maybe I should start eating at home, I was done! I asked for all my money, the entire 25 dollars. The cashier then got upset I guess because I was talking and letting it be known that their food was horrific, so he got out of line telling me to get the hell out the restaurant and then made the comment, ""black people"". Now mind you, this is a guy that's very dark, with a tear drop tattoo on his face and a gold in his mouth! Looks like he's a true thug who's done time. My skin tone is very light brown and I guarantee he would be called out as being black long before I would be! So that comment took me aback. I was shocked that these people would make those sort of ignorant comments and the manager would be so arrogant and ignorant as to let his employees do so and also not accept the complaints from a customer. Hopefully he reads this and understands that just because you claim you didn't or don't have any complaints, doesn't mean there's nothing wrong with the food! Please don't waste your time and money.

The mac & cheese was damn near perfect everything about it was on point, the cheesiness, the cook of the macaroni was perfect. The only way it could've been better is if I had more of it. The green beans were seasoned perfectly and they had some seasoned slices of potatoes in them, I've never had then that way but they were delicious.

I took my chances anyway and ordered oxtails, green beans, cabbage and mac n cheese. Pieces of oxtails were large as ribeye steaks. The oxtails were stacked on top of my sides making it hard for me to eat in my car without many napkins. I don't think food should be packaged so where it is mixed. I couldn't enjoy my sides because the oxtail grease had mixed in. The cabbage wasn't bad but had no meat. The oxtails had a peculiar taste and started to make my stomach hurt, so I decided to debone them when I got home and feed them to the outside cats. Once I started to do that when I got home, bugs immediately started swarming the oxtails suggesting to me the meat had some decay going on hence my stomachache. Mac n cheese was overcooked with velveeta sauce. Cornbread was dry and crumbly. I can't believe these ppl have been in business for so long making yucky food like this. Btw, when I went to pay for my food, which came to $15, the cashier started flashing a police badge at me. It was kind of weird. He didn't give me a receipt either.

Driving around my old neighborhood, we saw This Is It and decided to have lunch there. I had a vegetable plate with green beans, pinto beans, cabbage, and mac and cheese. My bf had meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and green beans. This is authentic soul food; tastes like a lot of things my grandma used to make. Everything was really tasty. The portions are HUGE, every table gets a basket of corn muffins, and the staff and patrons are friendly. Plus, for a homesick Houston girl, the place is sort of an elixir for the soul. My main critique revolves around this: even though the food was tasty, I think a lot of it was from a can and was saltier than I'm used to. So this is where I'm not sure whether to count this against the food or not, because honestly, we ate LOTS of canned vegetables in my youth -- fresh green beans are expensive! -- and so in that sense it's real soul food and maybe I shouldn't critique it for that. So just know going in. My tastes admittedly now lean to organic locavore (*hangs head*), so....take my review with that grain of salt.Finally, I also have to say that I loved this place purely because it's a black-owned business that dates back many decades. No small feat. And because when you walk in, it's completely down-home and unassuming. Given my mixed feelings about the gentrification of Third Ward, it's good to know there are still old businesses that thrive and serve both old and new communities in the area.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,houstons-this-is-it-soul-food-houston,houstons-this-is-it-soul-fhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/houstons-this-is-it-soul-food-houston?start=120,houstons-this-is-it-soul-food-houston,Adriann H.,"Houston, TX",352,5,1,,9/16/12,"With this being the first time going here, I've been always told that you WILL be in a food coma after, and trust there's no disappointment in that.

I would have loved to get the catfish that day, but because of the lunch special, opted to get the fried chicken instead. It was a normal size piece, and tended to be a little dry, but the skin helped repress my disappointment of that. The one thing that hits you the hardest however, is the size portion of the sides. I decided to get the macaroni & cheese and green beans that day, and that alone could have filled me up. The macaroni was first cooked on the stove, then baked which gave it a nice cheesy crust. The green beans were salted with back fat, but not too salty for consumption.

Their portions are very generous and between the food on my plate and the corn bread I was very full by the time I slid my chair out at the conclusion of the meal. I also had a few bites of my brother's sweet potatoes. I will echo the comments from other Yelpers that the mac and cheese was some of the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD. The sweet potatoes were also of he highest quality. I gave 4 stars because the chicken was a tad on the dry side, but it was breast meat which is understandable. I will be leaving Houston to go back to Los Angeles in two weeks and would encourage the proprietors of ""This Is It"" to expand into the Los Angeles market.

My old man brought some take-out home for the fam one night. On that night i saw bits & pieces of the movie 'Jason's Lyric' which was shot here in our home city, and a scene from that film was shot in this very kitchen. Then, as a child--who thought i could live off of beef jerky and Tom & Jerry--remembered how good it was...the hype had much to do w/ it. Recently on a busy Sunday i got in line to be taken back to my youth. I could smell the fresh greens while looking at them steam the glass pane it waited behind. Some days throughout the week they serve some Soul Food fave's like catfish, oxtails, ribs, pork chops and the list goes on. From my understanding, only if you're hungry you are welcome to dine in. Classic among all soul food kitchens in the city, 'This Is It' has merit as a historical part of Houston. Originated in 4th Ward back in the day, still around waiting for you to come in and top-off your meal w/ old fashioned T'cake, Pound Cake, and Pies for dessert. The staff will slab on a serving of their choosy selections of the day & all you've got to do is pick a weapon, fork, spoon or knife. My only fit w/ their cooking is the sometimes sweet veggies they make. To me, veggies shouldn't be sweet...to me. Preachers still sin every once in a while, children lie to their parents, and everybody's guilty of imperfection. So healthy dieters are allowed one day to deviate from your free-range organic routine and charge yourself a meal here that you can pay for tomorrow.

I've gotten two referrals from my son and grandbaby mama on this trip to Houston, that just haven't lived up to the hype. This Is It was one of those referrals. I've driven by This Is It about 15X since arriving here, due to its proximity to my son and grandbaby mama's alma mater (TSU). By the way, if you're searching Gray St. in Midtown for this place, STOP. IT'S BEEN MOVED to Blodgett St, near the university. Now, if you see yourself taking offense to this review, I'd like to reiterate the disclaimer I first published with my review of Sandra Dee's in Sacramento. Look it up, and come back.So it's soul food . . . 1 meat, 3 sides, served cafeteria style, to eat in or to go. The wife had meatloaf, with green beans, yams and mac & cheese. The offspring had fried chicken, corn, beans, and mac & cheese. Grandbaby Mama had smothered pork chops, yams, mac & cheese and green beans. For dessert, wife has been craving peach cobbler for days, and bought some. The boy had chocolate cake. The wife bought a 1/2 dozen corn muffins to share. I just nibbled once or twice off the wife's plate, b/c I was still full from the catfish & grits I had for breakfast.Everybody, almost in unison, said . . . 'uhhhh . . .' The food was . . . well, it was a'ight. But that's all. The fried chicken was kinda flavorless. It needed lots of hot sauce. Grandbaby Mama hardly touched her food; but then, she's extremely finicky. Besides, she recommended Pappa's BBQ to us, so shall we discount her opinion altogether from this point forward? Yes, let's.The wife and I were impressed with the mac & cheese; it was VERY good. The meatloaf was good, too. The rest of the sides were just a notch below average. And the corn muffins were desert dry! The peach cobbler sucked, according to the wife; it was runny like soup, and the ""crust"" was wet dough. The devil's food cake was okay; it was just missing some flavor . . .what was it? Oh, yeah: CHOCOLATE. Yes; a very faint chocolate flavor to a DEVIL'S FOOD CAKE. How do you even do that?It was the institutional version of home cooking. Which is perfectly fine, at home cooking prices. But you can't escape this place for under $12/person. At those prices, it needs to be really good, and this wasn't. Ultimately, the experience reinforced what should be a common idiom: If Home Cooking Was All That, All Of The Time, There Wouldn't Be So Many Restaurants.P.S.

We weren't all that hungry, so we shared a plate of oxtails, greens, green beans, and yams ($19 bucks for one plate and two sodas!!!!!!!). My first thought when we left was this: Sometimes you go to a place... you're not really in the mood for it, or you're not hungry, or you just happen to order the wrong thing. BUT, you'd go back, 'cause it's worth trying everything twice, if not three times... This place? Not so much.Maybe I'm spoiled by the jazzy, spicy Caribbean fare at the Reggae Hut (which even though, while it's similar in main ingredients, you can't really compare to soul food). But, I gotta say, I was unimpressed.. for the most part.The oxtails were fat-tails... seriously, we probably got about 5 forks of meat (and really, they weren't even forkfuls, just nibbles). The green beans tasted like they were grown south of Galveston beach (yeah, like in the ocean), they were so salty. And the greens, well, while overly salty as well, just didn't have much flavor to them -- usually (good) greens have that baconny, mildly sweet, flavor, you know? But, not these. The yams were the best part (and I'm not a big fan of yams), they were tasty, but a bit too sugary.And finally, everything was ALL MUSHY! It's a cafeteria-style joint, so you can see, pick, and choose what you're ordering. Everything I saw looked like it'd been run through the blender a couple times before it was set out. I don't know, I was just sorely disappointed. And maybe, since it's really my first experience with REAL soul food, maybe this is how it's supposed to be? But, it was just unappetizing to look at. And, maybe they do have some good tasting things in one of those pans of mush and blubber behind the counter. But, I just don't think I can go back.Now, don't get me wrong, it wasn't stomach turning. It was edible. And there was a decent crowd who all seemed to be regulars and enjoying their meals. So, maybe I missed something. But, I can't honestly give it more than 2 stars for my experience.Actually, the second star, I'm giving only because the service/waitstaff (minus one very strange and incomprehensible server) were very nice, and surprisingly home-style welcoming to us. Also, the bathrooms were sparkling, which is nice in a place (not that we ordered anything you had to eat with your hands) where the fare can certainly get messy depending on what you order, I think.I'm not saying don't check it out, 'cause it may've just been me and my date. Most people have given it decent, if not great, reviews. And I do so hate giving 2 stars. But, sometimes you just gotta be honest about not-so-good experiences. Maybe you'll have a better one -- let me know.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,houstons-this-is-it-soul-food-houston,houstons-this-is-it-soul-fhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/houstons-this-is-it-soul-food-houston?start=140,houstons-this-is-it-soul-food-houston,Ryan L.,"Houston, TX",142,281,,,7/27/10,"It sure is It.Good God.

Yes, the restaurant is the reason. I can pretty much order anything else here and give it the blase shoulder-shrug. However, the oxtails are in a league of their own.

We tasted what the owner of the restaurant advised since he was part of the service line. Pork chops, Fried chicken, and Ox tails. For our sides, we tried collard greens, cabbage, rice and gravy, mac n cheese, as well as the yams. The decent cornbread muffins that came with the meal was a plus. Everything was pretty good, but nothing I can't make better at home. However, the one thing that was better than the rest was the ox-tails. Oily, tender, and almost even slimy (not a word you want to hear, but it's the best I can come up with), but very satisfying and delicious. The biggest complaint was the hour long wait. The line stretched all around the whole restaurant almost back to where the food serving buffet was located. It was a neat experience, and rock-hard comfort food, but nothing extraordinary.
