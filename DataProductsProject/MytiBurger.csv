Super casual with slightly grimy, old school drive-in vibes. The type of food that is perfect for when you want to sit at home alone in pajamas with a Netflix series on. And seriously... who else has sweet potato fries??? I can only think of a few places, and this place has great ones. Right now you can get cash back on Yelp even, so I'm not sure why you wouldn't step out on a limb and try these tasty, filling burgers. I had one with cheddar and mushrooms on it, and somehow I ended up eating the whole thing even though I was full already after a few bites.Great addition to the burger circuit, especially for days when you just need to be alone with your snacks.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,mytiburger-houston,mytiburger-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/mytiburger-houston?start=0,Alan S.,"Houston, TX",562,1393,230,Elite ’17,7/13/17,"This place is solid, and I totally agree with Belly G. that the customer service pushes this place from that 3 to a 4. I oped for a bacon cheese burger, onion rings and pineapple shake. This was more food then I needed, but I wanted to try all the things. The burger and the onion rings were both solid 3's. Taste good, good value, but not gonna wow you. The shake was pretty unique, very few places branch beyond the chocolate, vanilla, strawberry options, so I quite enjoyed the pineapple. If you live in the area, you should give it a try. It's a Houston institution as far as how long it's been around, so I'm glad to finally check the place off my list.

He said the owner is a local guy and shared a conversation about local sports teams since he seen my son had on his YMCA team shirt. When we arrived at mytiburger we were greeted by the cashier and were a little lost on how to order. After getting a double and a mytiburger we went to pay and the only thing sucked was the cashier.

They have 5 tables inside, 1 outside, and a drive-through. Old school burgers like what you'd get prior to the proliferation of chain joints. I had a cheeseburger, and they offer two options for real cheese, so I went with Cheddar. Several optional add-ons (for a price), and I went with avocado, which was actually guacamole, but I was down with that. Fries are foodservice fries, but were decent. They do offer fresh cut potatoes for a higher price.Service was quick. The food was good, and they even have bottled jalapeno ketchup. It's hard to argue with peppers being added to very many things. Sure, Blue Bell ice cream would not be improved that way, but they weren't selling Blue Bell anyway. Reasonably priced, my cheeseburger with avocado and a small fry order (which is decent sized) came to just $7.65 plus a tip for the folks who made it. They also take credit and debit cards, which is nice. I would definitely go back here again.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,mytiburger-houston,mytiburger-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/mytiburger-houston?start=0,Cindy P.,"Houston, TX",17,6,2,,9/1/17,Thank you Mytiburger for being open this week when no one else was.

The friendly service everyone is raving about wasn't there tonight, that was also average...maybe Saturday evenings are not the best time to go. The smell of grease was so pervasive on entering, that it was unappetizing. Maybe a better exhaust fan is in order.Mytiburger with cheddar and loaded: good; fairly pricedRegular fries: too thick and soft, even tho' I asked for crispy; not worth the priceService was slow, but understandable since it is all made to order. However, they should have gone ahead and given us our drinks right away and let me pay instead of filling all orders ahead of us fully before they even gave us our drinks. Then I still had to wait to pay when we actually got our food. The people working the counter didn't even greet us when we came in or as we were figuring out our order. I think it was fairly obvious we had never been there before. There was only one other couple there at the time.They did give refills on our sodas and were very kind to a homeless man who came in for some ice water. Keep up the good work that you do for your community and congrats on 50 years of business. I will go through the drive through if in the area again for a burger and try something besides the fries.

I can take your order when you're ready."" This is probably what you will be hearing upon entering Mytiburger. Always friendly people no matter what time of the day you walk in there.They have a variety of burgers to choose from. You can build your own, or you can have whatever they list on the menu. Although I love their burgers, I usually come in here eating a double chicken sandwich with a side of fried pickles and/or lemon pie. The chicken breast is juicy and not dry. Probably not as healthy as I want it to be, but damn it! It's delicious!I've also tried their variety of burgers. Cheeseburgers. Buffalo burgers. Build my own burgers and I have not been disappointed yet. Yeah, it's probably not as good as Bernie's or Stanton's. But if you want something quick, affordable, and you're in the area, you can't go wrong coming here.They also serve desserts. Lemon, cherry, and apple pies. They also serve milkshakes although I have yet to try the shakes yet. I've never personally tried the fries, so I can't comment on that.As for the restaurant itself, it's pretty tiny. They have four tables for four, one table for two, and one waiting table inside; and they have one table for two outside. During lunch hour, this place gets kind of packed so you probably want to take yours to go. Or, you can be like me and come in after lunch hours.My rating for this place is really a 3.5 but I'm rounding up due to the niceness of the people (Seriously! They're THAT nice!)","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,mytiburger-houston,mytiburger-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/mytiburger-houston?start=0,Andrew L.,"Houston, TX",5,1,,,4/24/16,"Hate to do it because the food is really good but this is the 3rd time in a row it's happen. But the service is terrible. Drive thru needs to be majorly fixed.

Nothing overly fancy or special, just some good old fashioned burgers and fries (though five guys may still have them beat on the fries).The wife and I both loved it, and it's a mile away from us, so we'll definitely be back.

Your belly gets THAT craving. It starts out with a simple little hankering for a burger. You let the thought subside, moving on the the next want or need in your steady stream of consciousness. The burger thought drops by politely every few days saying, ""Hidey-ho, friend! Just lettin' ya know I'm here if ya need me."" You give it a nice wave, but really, you wish he'd go away. A week goes by before he's basically banging on your door, blocking the peephole, and you give in. That happened today.Determined to take care of my #burgerproblem, I promptly drove to my neighborhood go-to, Hubcap Grill, only to find it's CLOSED ON SUNDAYS? NO!!!! Without missing a beat, I maneuvered my way to Itty Bitty Burger Barn.....CLOSED AT 5!?! How is this happening?Some things are just meant to be. That pesky burger in my head was fate that Mytiburger and I were supposed to meet. I pulled up to the old school ""burgery"", charmed by it's classic decor. It's what all fast food joints must have looked like before they commercialized in the early 70's. My ""manz"" and I spat out our classic orders: mushroom Swiss with grilled onions, sub Swiss for American and sweet potato fries for me, and a bacon, cheddar, jalapeno double patty and regular fries for him. Our meals came out 10 minutes later smelling sinful and glorious. My burger ""shakes"" began to slow as I examined my sweet potato fries first and thanked myself for going with my first instinct and foregoing the idea of tater tots as the side. Stunning in gold, my fries were crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside, the way all sweet ""potats"" should be. The burger patty was served thin and as medium as you can pull off for the size, making a perfect meat to bun ratio. Speaking of buns, Myti's was the no frills type but tasted fresh and fluffy - creating a sound roof and foundation for my grilled onions, ''shrooms and melted cheese. One bite in, and the burger monster who had taken over all of my thoughts and sanity had proceeded to start harassing someone other than me. The world made sense again.Meanwhile, I looked up at my boyfriend who had managed to deplete his size-able burger in no time at all which indicated his pleasure with the gluttonous meal. He noted that the toppings were what set this burger apart from others - namely, the thick cut bacon. His regular fries were the one minor flaw, medium size in cut and lacking the crisp I enjoyed in the sweeter variety. Perhaps, the tots are the way to go in this scenario.We completed our meal with Myti's famous chocolate shakes, which I found to be standard, but enjoyable nonetheless. As I reflect on the meal, I realize my burger ""pest"" was in fact some sort of supernatural premonition for Mytiburger and I to cross paths . I will forever be thankful, as you never know the next time you need an amazing classic burger on a Sunday afternoon. In fact, this burger proved to be a mighty fine burger for any time of the week. Bottom Line: Mytiburger is synonymous with everything that I love about the Oak Forest area. It's an underrated gem, with a classic flavor that stands the test of time.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,mytiburger-houston,mytiburger-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/mytiburger-houston?start=60,Amy O.,"San Antonio, TX",65,12,3,,8/2/15,"Good burger!

The burgers were much better years ago but the fries were never good, IMO (no salt). We got a Groupon and ccalled beforehand to see if they would take it the same day. We were told yes and got there shortly after. We ordered our food and when it came time to present the piece of paper, the staff tried to tell us that it was expired or already used. We explained (and showed proof) that it was just printed and brand new, therefore it was impossible for it to be ""expired or used"". The staff got rude and called up their boss who was even more rude and they tried to get us to pay a difference on our food to ""cover their costs for the food"". What is the purpose of a Groupon if you do not know how to work them or if they are going to try and insinuate it was an expired one? They could see it was good till the end of this year and it was a glitch of some sort but I was still angry at their lack of professionalism and their incompetence.My husband said it was the driest burger he has had and said he will not ever go back. I thought it was mediocre at best and agreed with him. We went here because another well-known place we like was closed. I just did not enjoy the place, at all.Update- We spoke with Groupon and they said that they had no idea why it came up as used or expired but it surely was not and it sounded like an error. They had it in their system that it was completely good and they would contact the company about it. Maybe I could not hear the person on the other line, but its been sorted out. Maybe in the future we will give them a try again.

They said that I would enjoy the food especially the shakes.So during finals week, I was finally able to check this place out and well it may not have been the best food I have ever eaten, this place did have a lot of character and the people working were friendly and made it a place I would go back to just to support local businesses.My coworker and I walked in and were immediately greeted by a couple of ladies behind the counter. That was a definite plus because I have had some experiences in the past where some smaller businesses just don't have the service. I told the lady that it was our first time and she welcomed us in even more and began to go over the menu. The menu was quite extensive for such a small place and I noticed that they also have a drive thru! After looking over the menu, I decided on the buffalo burger, fries, and Texas sticks (fried onion strings and jalapeno slices). My coworker got a bacon cheeseburger without the bun since she's allergic to gluten. When she said no bun the lady taking the order asked her why and she explained her situation. The lady was very curious and asked about buns or bread that they could buy to serve people who had gluten allergies. Who knows if they will expand their bread selection to include gluten-free bread but it was thoughtful that she asked and considered the options.We waited for our food and the price was average for a burger joint, but it's definitely not a cheap burger (think fast food prices) option type of place. We went back to work to enjoy our food. The food definitely smelled good. Now it was just the taste test remaining. I munched on the Texas sticks first and I was a bit disappointed because it didn't have as many jalapenos as I would like. It was mainly onion strings. The breading and flavor were both OK (I did wish for more heat from the jalapenos) but i think next time I would just order either fried jalapenos or fried onions. The burger was a bit on the dry side which was very disappointing. Would I go back? More than likely I'll try some other stuff on the menu and definitely order the shake so I can see if it lives up to the hype. Service was a great the day I went, which gave them an extra star. All in all a local business I'm willing to try again.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,mytiburger-houston,mytiburger-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/mytiburger-houston?start=100,C L.,"Richmond, TX",1,13,,,8/15/13,"Food was okay, service was mediocre to poor. We ordered quickly but the guy spoke so low I had no idea what he was saying over the din of the restaurant, and seemed kind of annoyed when I kept asking what he said. I went to pay and stood there, right in front of a woman working the register, for five minutes while she completely ignored me and helped a customer picking up a takeout order that walked up after I did. I was still standing there, money in hand, when a different staff guy came over and told me I was to pay when it was ready. I go sit down, and the lady calls out my order for pickup, so I go back up, and this time she was courteous, but I don't know why she (or anyone else) couldn't say a word before when it was obvious that I didn't know what to do. The drive through speaker is very loud and annoying. The food was alright but not so special that I would deal with the staff again to get it.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,mytiburger-houston,mytiburger-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/mytiburger-houston?start=100,Allie O.,"Sparks, NV",0,26,,,8/21/14,"Simply great cheeseburgers and breakfast tacos!

Upon entering, the friendly proprietors are ready to take your order, from the basic Mytiburger for $3.15 to bacon cheeseburgers, steak sandwiches, or fried catfish baskets for a few dollars more. I opted for the Mytiburger with cheese, added jalapeños, and got a half and half of fries and onion rings, all for $6 and change. The fries and rings came out hot and crispy, if unremarkable, but the burger was fantastic for as cheap as it was. A large, juicy patty on a pillowy soft bun with lettuce, tomato, pickle and mustard. Not having perused the menu extensively, I noticed after I sat down that they also have things like sweet potato fries that were unexpected, and will require another trip.The interior is pretty small, with only a few tables and booths off to the side. There are some patio tables out front, provided the heat isn't too oppressive. But regardless of their dine-in capacity, Mytiburger appears to do a brisk pick-up and drive-thru business, with several regulars known by name coming in while I ate. The young, hip generation that has taken up residence in the Heights hasn't pushed as far as 43rd, so the older, laid back generation still dominates and they love their familiar burger joints. This makes Mytiburger similar to Roznovsky's in a lot of ways, just up TC Jester, but I'd have to say Mytiburger offers more bang for the buck - the burger was bigger yet cheaper.Yes sir, when hunger wants to take a bite,Myti Burger will join the fight!","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,mytiburger-houston,mytiburger-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/mytiburger-houston?start=100,Keith G.,"Medical Center, Houston, TX",9,4,,,2/18/13,Sometimes you crave a burger without all of the fancy fixings.

It looks like a '50s diner from the outside and is still intimate and fun on the inside. There is limited seating inside, with a '70s decor that doesn't exactly give the place its '50s persona it regales people from the outside. Walking in, just get in line and check out the old school menu signs, which lists a variety of burgers and check out the chalkboard for the daily specials. So far, the food hasn't been an eye-opening experience but the prices aren't that expensive; there is a variety to choose from and next time, I will definitely order a malt from the place. This might be the saving grace of the place. Also, I was intrigued by the drive-thru that I seemed to have glazed over on my quest for a nice greasy hamburger. You might get the food faster if you do the drive-thru (I waited a good 10-15 minutes for my order, which I suspect was because of the large orders ahead of me but also because of their homemade onion rings) but overall, the inside of the place kept me entertained with its kitchness and Coca-Cola memorabilia. Still, the kitch can only save it for so longer. The hamburgers aren't as big and as juicy as I thought and the onion rings were a bit too greasy for my taste. Even with this, I still will be interested in coming back and having a malt or a root beer float. Insiders note: You can call ahead and order a large meal for pick up.
