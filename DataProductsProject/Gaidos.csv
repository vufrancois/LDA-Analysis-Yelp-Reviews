Got a reservation for 4:30 and arrived with my sister. We were seated, but no sign of the server for ten minutes. I had to get up and ask the greeter to get our server, who, upon showing up, said ""I didn't know you were here."" Which means she wasn't covering her station (and it wasn't busy). In any case we told her we were going to have the buffet and she said that's fine.About 2/3 of the way through our meal I went to get something from the buffet only to be told it had closed at 3:30. It did look picked over and some items were missing when we first went up around 4:40, but we thought nothing of it, figuring stuff would be replenished. I talked to the manager about the situation (primarily caused by our problematic server) and he was very attentive and gracious and Gaidos made the situation right for us.

Entering the restaurant, it is a white linens ambience combined with history on the walls from their extensive past. We were dressed casually but did not feel out of place with the other diners. We were shown our table relatively quickly. Our waiter, Keenan, was very attentive, friendly and efficient. We had the crawfish fritters. I would definitely recommend them. They were fantastic. Keenan then suggested the Red Snapper Michael with the Crab Beurre Blanc. It was incredible, so I was very happy I took his suggestion. My husband had the combination platter with tile fish. He found his to be delicious. He had his blackened but it was not overcooked. Desert was Key Lime Pie and we loved that as well.From start to finish the service was great and the food was good.

After visiting Commander's Palace this summer, we can easily say, we prefer Gaido's.It remains family owned and operated since 1911 and has remained Galveston's premier restaurant for over 100 years.I have read several reviews critical of the fried seafood at Gaido's, just don't eat fried foods and most of your problems will be solved.

Don't come for a burger or even a steak, shell out some extra money for the fresh seafood. And come to Gaido's. You'll enjoy the splash of nolstagia as you see those green mid century chairs in the lounge, classy tables in a casual yet sophisticated atmosphere, and excellent histories of Galveston on the walls. We had Sally, who was an excellent server. She would offer things like bringing out kids' meals and keep our glasses full without us asking. When she found out this was the first time dining @Gaido's, she did an admirable job in explaining the menu, sharing why Gaido's only uses fresh local fish (with a couple exceptions), and recommending her favorites. We ended up going family style and getting the crab cakes and the calamari as an appetizer, and sharing three entries - the grouper (seasonal special), the redfish, and the shrimp platter. The redfish was slightly overlooked, but this was overshadowed by the grouper- it was excellent. We also thought the calamari was a standout for us. We finished off with the creme brûlée (easily one of the best choices on the menu) and the bread pudding topped with vanilla ice cream. Both were good choices and great to share with the family.

So I'm in Galveston on a couple of business meetings and it just so happened to be my birthday. We needed grub and a full bar; oddly enough that's hard combination to find on the Seawall for lunch. I consult my handy dandy Yelp app for some Elite Super Star suggestions. This place seemed to have great reviews and good seafood, it's a go.Greeted by a friendly hostess and advised there was in fact a full bar. I felt like I was in a high end restaurant from the movie Casino, I watched the door for River De Niro or Joe Pesci to arrive at any given moment. The green volure chairs with wheels just screamed 70s Vegas strip. The chifferobe just may have been my Granny's but the inch of dust made me think otherwise.We sat in the bar area that way the drinks would flow. Waiter was very nice and answered any questions we had about the menu very thoroughly as he has been working there for quite some time. Drinks, crab cakes, grilled oysters and stuffed shrimp were ordered. The food came out very quickly, fresh and hot! However, everything was quite bland and without any hint of season. They did not skip on the crab meat! The oysters had just a bit too much butter for my liking but were a nice size, grilled to perfection. The stuffed shrimp were ok once some salt, pepper and a little hot sauce from my bag were added.... I didn't mention the drinks did I. Because the waiter forgot them!! He was very chatty and had too many stories and not one drink on hand!All and all the visit was just ok. It is time they updated the place and add a little flavor to the menu.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-https://www.yelp.com/biz/gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2?start=0,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,Liana R.,"Houston, TX",84,262,623,Elite ’17,9/9/17,"You really can't tell by the outside the scope of what's going on inside this restaurant! It's really lovely! Check in was well-managed on a busy Saturday night for 2 walk-ins without a reservation. Bathrooms were clean and well-managed with a switch to flip if it needed any attention (so nice not to have to go tell anyone the bathroom needs attention)! The lounge/bar area has plenty of seating and I LOVED the foofy green upholstered chairs on wheels that pull up to the glass tables! The bartender was on it and my Peach Bellini's were very good. My husband had a mojito he said gave him a buzz! Then moved on to his normal Stella's. Enjoyed reading the history and seeing the pictures of the raising of the island and 2400+ homes after the big hurricane in 1904. We were seated at a perfect, white linen covered table by the window so we could see the traffic, the sea wall and the lights on the water, mostly from all the ships waiting for their turn to enter the ship canal. OMG, then the Spinach Dip with Lump Crab Meat and bread came and that's when I realized I wasn't going to be able to order a full dinner if I also wanted to try a desert! At that point, the bartender came up and asked if I had my wedding ring and, darn me, I'd left it on the glass table because I'd put on lotion and the buzzer went off that our table was ready and distracted me. Thank God, I was so thankful because I've had that ring for 27 years! My husband told the bartender I'm always trying to get rid of him - LOL! The waitress was very good at her job, attentive and nice. She was contracted and brought over from Ukraine to work at this restaurant and had been there for a couple years so knew a bit about the history of the restaurant. Being the history nerds we are, of course we asked questions and she very sweetly answered them all. The owners originally opened their restaurant in 1906 on the pier along with Murdochs. When the pier was destroyed by a hurricane in 1936, they moved to their current location, so it's a classic, traditional restaurant in the area and not just catering to tourists. I think it was easy to see that blend of locals and tourists in the restaurant and no matter whether people were dressed vacation casual or local elegant, we were all treated with the same quality service. We finished the appetizer, both got another of our drinks and my husband got the Lobster Bisque. He let me try a bit, it was really rich so I don't think I could have eaten a whole cup, but it was very delicious! Next came my au gratin potatoes and wedge salad. I ate a few bites of both but was just getting too full and I still wanted to try their award winning pecan pie. My husband had the chefs catch of the day - swordfish, and the sides that came with it. He really enjoyed his meal and gave me a little taste of the fish - YUM! Our waitress packed up all our leftovers and then brought us a pecan pie to share. It had a dollop of vanilla ice cream so we ate that part and packed up the rest to take home to our kids. And after she brought us the bill, she brought out these little silver half cups with water and lemon slices in them for dipping our fingers in to clean them. I just loved this restaurant experience from beginning to end. We went outside, put our leftovers in the car and walked across the street to take an after dinner stroll on the beach. That's when we noticed that Gaidos also has an inn! Now we want to check that out, too. After walking maybe a mile, we turned to walk back, both just feeling relaxed and talking about how great the evening was.

Now, if we had spent about $15.00 per entree, maybe the experience would have been a little more acceptable. But this meal for two was a touch over $100.00 when all was said and done. And for somewhat bland, sub-par blackening and claws that were small and just not very fresh or innovative as far as sauces....it was just such a let-down! About half-way through our meal, we looked across the table and saw one another's crestfallen expressions and had to admit that we had wasted our one meal in Galveston.

They made it a point to express they were proudly in business for over 100 years. The exterior gives the unsuspecting guest no hint that this is a sophisticated dining experience. It is tastefully appointed with polished wooden walls and trim, sea-faring historical decor, leather chairs, white table cloths and large windows that give you the ambiance that you are dining with the Captain of an old ship. We arrived on a Friday around 5pm and were greeted and seated right away. The restaurant was nice and quiet at that time.We began our experience with drinks and an appetizer. My husband ordered a Bloody Mary and I decided on a glass of Riesling after consulting with the Sommelier. The wine list is extensive but very limited for a single glass. His Bloody Mary arrived in a rock glass filled with ice. It was the smallest one I have ever seen. Our waitress brought the wine in a tiny carafe and when she poured it into the wine glass, it filled it less than 1/3 full. Very disappointing. Right then I knew I would want another and was sorry I hadn't ordered a bottle instead. So I did. Our server, Bailley, was very sweet, efficient and cheerful. The bread was homemade, soft and tasty when dunked in the olive oil/spice blend. (We went through a loaf and a half by the time dinner was served.) She described a few appetizers and we asked if the Asparagus Michael was big enough to share. Her words: ""Oh yes, it is huge!"" When it arrived via another server, we were a bit taken aback. It was 7 slim asparagus, coated with a partially crispy coating and had one little dollop of crab flakes in a Beurre Blanc sauce - less than 2 tablespoons with sauce and crab. Almost totally devoid of crab. This is huge? I was hoping this was not a sign of things to come...Bailley returned to the table after we had finished it and was shocked to hear how it was served. She said she would speak to someone about it, but never mentioned it again. She advised us at that time that our order had a glitch and hubby's entree was ready but mine had gotten ""lost"". I advised her to serve him his now while hot. Fifteen minutes later they both came out together (and his was not hot but warm and no longer very crispy). We both had ordered the Combination Platter - His fried, mine was grilled. The side choices were very limited - Parmesan Tomatoes; Steamed Asparagus; Steak Fries or a Baked Potato for $1.50 extra. (The menu online has many more choices for sides and I am curious as to why it wasn't offered.) The meal included Grilled Shrimp, Sea Scallops, and Golden Tile. His side was the Parmesan tomatoes and were very good; his seafood served over french bread toast (not mentioned on menu). I opted for the Baked Potato - not knowing that the grilled meal came with Rice Pilaf. There was no mention of this on the menu and she never mentioned it. I would have opted for the Parmesan Tomatoes had I been informed. The seafood was fresh and delicious. The Tile fish was scrumptiously buttery. The Scallops were huge and tender. The Shrimp were large. The accompanying butter mixture was tasty for dipping. Everything tasted very good. I noticed that hubby received four large scallops and I three (all same large size) - and he thought that because his was fried was the reason. So we asked Bailley if that was so. She said ""No, they should come with the same amount as they are the same platter"" and said she would check on that. She never mentioned it again either. We had our leftovers packaged to go and she was kind enough to throw in another loaf of the bread. It was now almost 6:30pm. Total cost before tip $139.11.We just couldn't fit dessert after all the bread we consumed before the meal. It was a good dinner; but with the issues that were left unaddressed, the tiny portions of drinks and meal issues at those prices- I can only give them three stars.

My friends and I came here after a morning spent on the beach looking for seafood to continue our beachy day. We ordered an array of appetizers to share as we wanted the chance to try as many different dishes as possible. First, the raw bluepoint oysters were fresh, outstanding and reasonably priced. There was even an extra one thrown in our half dozen which was a lovely bonus. The calamari though not very crisp tasted delicious. The seasonings and cheese complimented each other well. I enjoyed the crawfish fritters but my friends found them to be too bready. We all enjoyed the dipping sauces that they came with however. Next we ate the jumbo lump crab cake which was large and chock full of crab meat but the sauce was underwhelming.

We enjoyed the pictures from the early 20th century and looked up the historic buildings while driving around town later. The service was friendly, efficient and plentiful. In an era of short staffing, it is nice to see they put a premium on having enough service staff to serve a big crowd well and keep everyone happy. We were never once left breadless or with a dry glass. All around the table the food was delicious, prepared well, seasoned perfectly and plated beautifully. From the fried catfish and shrimp, to the seared tuna steak, to the grilled shrimp, scallops and fish of the day, it was all impeccable. You can always tell about the chef's attention to detail by the care they take with the veggies. The al dente vegetables were perfectly crisp, beautiful and delicious.

I had the Blackened Yellowfin Tuna which I was happy to eat, but lacked a certain flare. My taste buds were content, not wowed. The real upset for me was the potatoes au gratin. Our table ordered two to share. The first one I tried was under cooked; the potatoes were still slightly crunchy. The second one was thankfully cooked all the way through. They had an interesting tang to them. Some of us liked it, others did not. My uncle said he preferred the boxed potatoes au gratin but I think that was a bit of an overstatement. Overall I liked my experience here. It is a favorite of my grandparents.

The music selections playing in the background are the likes of Frank Sinatra and variety of jazz genres.Elena is our attentive waitress/server and she begins her detailed descriptions of all the top entrees and local favorites. I finally decided on the Crab Stuffed Shrimp covered in Beurre Blanc, which is their signature lemon butter sauce and my side was Broiled Tomatos topped with melted Parmesan and Mozzarella Cheese. Hubby chose the Snapper Michael, which is sautéed red snapper dusted in a parmesan cheese seasoned flour with a side of Asparagus. While we await the arrival of our food, we are given the most magnificent Black Pepper Chedder Cheese Bread paired with Olive Oil infused with herbs. Talk about OMG because this bread was ridiculously soft, seasoned and delicious. Seafood never takes long to prepare, so wait time was less then 10 minutes. However, when we finally had our entrees, all conversation ceased. My Crab Stuffed Shrimp was creamy and full of flavor. The white sauce was rich and lemony but was a nice contrast to my seafood overload. I also immediately feel in love with my Broiled Tomatos which tasted like healthier miniature pizzas. With excellent customer service and food, I know that we will be back. We were so impressed with it all, that we had to meet the manager, Brandon Ray. He preceded to invite us to try their other neighboring restaurant, Nick's Kitchen and Beach Bar (Review coming soon).TROY'S PERSPECTIVE:After ordering the Snapper Michael, I was quite surprised by the fried fish that I received. I did not hear our waitress, Elena explain the exact preparation of the snapper. She was very apologetic, but my wife being a true food connoisseur, assured me that the preparation was thoroughly explained. Being adventurous in a new place, I went along with the adventure and ate the snapper. The snapper that was sautéed golden brown with parmesan flour was well-seasoned and very moist. It had a slight crunch on the outside and a burst of goodness on the inside. The asparagus was lightly seasoned, crunchy and cooked just right.

We drive from Houston to dine at Gaido's ....But our last visit had us so disappointed, from beginning to end ... Just not what we have come to expect from Gaido's ...First, we waited over 30 min. for a table, which is not normally bad for Gaido'sBut there where many empty tables and yet they had several parties waiting.We had several tables around us that did not have anyone seated, for the time we were there.One of the appetizer we ordered the Creole Crawfish Fondue, it was sent back, it was a bowl of gue ... Looked bad and tasted like it had been made the day before, rubbery crawfish.The others were ok, nothing to note or write about.We all thought, ever place has an off day and waited for our salads ....I had ordered a Caesar salad, which I had had there last time I was there, not too long ago.That time it was a work of art .... Whole leaves of romaine lettuce, shaved parm. house made croutons and their dressing ... It was wonderful and exactly what I had expected.This time a plate of Luke warm romaine lettuce with croutons and dressing,Just wast not up to the Gaido's standards ... I was ready to leave ... But the others were hungry and did not want to go wait in another line.The only plate that was good was the fried seafood plater, which you can get almost any chain seafood joint. I had the stuffed flounder, it was all right but again, not what I expected.My wife's plate was picked at but not much better,Our guests just looked at us and said, this place is not as we had described.The service was also a disappointment, not the white table cloth level we have had before.They seemed to be high school girls, that could not even keep out glasses filled.I waited several days to post this, to try and put the experience behind us ...But for the price, it should have been better.I should have thought about it when I saw they only had 3 1/2 stars.I asked the girl waiting on us if the restaurant had been sold lately,She said she was not sure, but she didn't think so.If the Gaido's still own it, they need to see what's going on in their Galveston institution of the past.After sending things back, and most plates going untouched,No one asked why, we did not talk to a manager or anyone.I know everything is changing in our world today,But I don't think I have been this disappointed in a landmark restaurantNo sure we will ever go back ....And that is sad as Gaido's holds so many Great special memories ....Well we have those, and that is way I gave 2 stars.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-https://www.yelp.com/biz/gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2?start=120,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,Sally C.,"Houston, TX",4,21,2,,9/25/16,"Been eating here over 65 years.

If I was a drinking man which I am I probably would have knocked back a few cocktails for another $20.I'm sure you would have been smitten by my wife who would also have ordered one of your $30 shrimp dishes.. Did I mention she is a huge wine lover? Bring over your best bottle of pinot noir for another $35. Dessert? Heck yeah not to mention one of my favorite appetizers in the world (crawfish cheesecake) for another $20.Well, that didn't happen today. With your restaurant at about 25% capacity, we were asked to come back an hour and a half later. Same thing with about 25 other folks that arrived around 4:15 in the afternoon to avoid the dinner rush. We're called early birds, you know so we don't eat too much to late?Just crunching some raw numbers if I was gonna hand you over $100 for a meal, you most likely would take that all day long. Oh, and those other folks I was telling you about earlier? They hand you roughly another $100 per table. That's sure alot of money that your family gave up today.Besides the family business, what about your employee that didn't make a $20 tip on just my table alone. Times are tough here in 2013 especially for restaurant staffers so I'm sure I could have paid for some groceries with that money. Wait, I have a solution.One night when you're not too busy pushing up daisies come back to haunt your current management. Tell them there complete morons for not serving people when you have plenty of space. Keep enough servers to cover your diners after lunch thru the dinner service.

Our ONLY complaint was that there were NO gluten-free desserts available at the end of our meal. (Our waiter checked with the chef who confirmed the pecan crunch and pecan ball now contains flour. Even their crème brule has flour!) I had clearly told the reservation agent that we were there to celebrate our anniversary and my husband is gluten-free.

I would say the business has 'character'. There is a lot of history displayed around the restaurant and as such, there is a vast array of artifacts dating from when the restaurant opened in the early 1900's through present day.That aside, my wife and decided to dine here for our 6th wedding anniversary. We made sure to make reservations ahead of time and were glad we did as the approximate wait time for walk-ins was running about 90 minutes.Our waitress was younger and full of energy and had apparently been there a while as she seemed to have the routine down. We received excellent service from her while we were there. This experience can vary, I'm sure depending on who you get.We ordered both a bowl of Shrimp Gumbo and the Lump Meat Crab Dip for appetizers (my wife's a Gemini) and were more than pleased with both. They both came out hot and were terrific! Although I like Pappa's Shrimp Gumbo style a little better, I could not stop eating Gaido's version. For our main course, we split the Grilled Shrimp, Grilled Scallops, and Mahi Mahi Combination platter. The food came out very well prepared, hot, and seasoned perfectly.We followed up the meal with a serving of Creme Brule' which was also very good. I was expecting them to brule it at the table, but it was brought out cold. I've actually had it room temperature and hot before and I think I prefer it a little warmer. It was still, hands down, one of the better Creme Brule dishes I've had.Its very rare for any restaurant to make -0- mistakes and I'm sure we just had everything going just right for us that night, but it was truly a perfect evening and a great anniversary Dinner! Thanks, Gaido's!","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-https://www.yelp.com/biz/gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2?start=180,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,Lou L.,"Waxahachie, TX",0,12,,,6/24/16,"This place was recommended by a friend and it was wonderful.

It was his birthday so I wanted to treat him to a special meal. He got the flounder with the crabmeat and I got the same minus the crab. Daddy loved his food. My complaint lies with the waiter. He rarely checked on us. I had to flag him down and ask for additional drinks. He boxed up my fathers food to go but not mine and brought me my check without offering me the dessert menu I had to ask for it. I ordered my desert to go and they charged my credit card twice for individual purchases. One for our meal and another for my dessert. Lastly the waiter comes over to apologize for being absent due to him not feeling well but him made sure he looked at my receipt to see what I tipped him and then slipped away while the stand in waiter helped us.

It was fresh and spongey cake with creamy and light frosting topped with fresh berries. Fantastic! We are making Gaidos a family tradition everytime we go to Galveston.

Then I see my waiter happily chatting with the same table over on the other side of the dining room as we waited for the rest of the dishes to be cleared.Once it was time for the bill, we waited patiently after our waiter indicated he would bring it.

We sit at our table and look over the menu for a while discussing with our friends what's good to eat and finally our server walks up and introduced herself as Anna... The only thing we could understand from her was the grouper fish special which my friend ordered. We ordered a few appetizers Oysters and 2 calamari's and a round of drinks. I was telling my guest that the bread here is very good, soft and great sourdough taste.. Well we never got the bread... I had ordered the New York strip with blue cheese grits and parmesan tomatoes. I had not eaten all day I was looking forward to dinner and wanted to save my appetite. Hummm I received my steak and could tell immediately it looked over done for my taste, so I thought it's the outside maybe inside will be better, I cut it open and took a bite it was chewy and tough... My friend who ordered the grouper never got it, instead it was lump crab which tasted very good so he just kept it, my husband and girlfriend where eating and I sat there waiting for Anna to come back, I explained it was over cooked, she took it back and within 6 mins brought me another steak which was the same steak cooked longer.... Ugggg so she set it down and left I cut into it and thought it's over done now much harder to cut and looked yuck, I waited and waited and she didn't come back so I asked another waiter if we could get some bread and I'll just eat that with my blue cheese grits, waiting for Anna to come back she never did, at this point everyone was almost done with dinner while I'm looking at mine and waiting, I had flagged down another waiter and asked to speak to a manger he shows up I explained the problem he took my steak and then came back with another steak, which now it's the 3rd time I cut into it and noticed it's very tough and still not right, cause by this time everyone was done eating and waiting on me that I didn't say anything I just took it cut 2 bites and was totally disappointed that I just asked for a to go box... We had plans for a play after that we didn't make due to waiting for my food... After the 3rd time I didn't want to say anything cause everyone was waiting on me and everyone at our table was being nice about it cause it was my birthday, so I just acted like I was getting full cause I knew we were already running late to our show, and I didn't want to say nothing the forth time. Needless to say I was very disappointed in the food and service we received tonight.

I believe Anna may be new and wasn't sure what I said and had them cook it longer although she was on cue with our drinks the rest of service was terrible, my husband is burping up grease from the fried shrimp he ordered, my friend didn't get the grouper he was looking forward to although his lump crab was deli shish. After our almost 300 bill we still tipped our waitress 22% cause she still provided a service to us and we felt sorry for her, thinking she's new. As much as we love this restaurant it may be a while before we go back. We missed our show and I stopped to get tacos on the way back home.... Maybe they have new cooks and a lot of new servers that need a bit more training...I wished I could of given a better review, but we left very disappointed and still hungry...

Landry's recently purchased them in the last few years, so the niche of this place being unique to Galveston Island is gone. It's not that Landry's ruins restaurants, but they generally lose their charm and quality of food once the Landry's corporation takes over. They commercialize the food, service, and even cheapen the marketing on a lot of these types of restaurants. Even before Landry's took them over, they seemed to be floundering in their ability to attract business with their high priced seafood.The smell was the first impression I had of Gaido's, and it wasn't a pleasant smell, nor was it a smell of food. The cleaning products they use to keep this place clean are so overwhelming and pungent that the taste of any food you eat is masked by it. I couldn't help but only remember this smell because it was so awful that the entire dining experience was pretty much forgettable. If the smell wasn't bad enough, the place looked old, and I don't mean nostalgic, I mean old. The furniture, the people, the carpet, the décor, it all had a very depressing feel to it that made me never want to step foot back in here.The service was better than average and my waiter was more than accommodating to any of my requests. He was also very knowledgeable about the menu and the items that were the most popular, most flavorful, or the ones not to order. I always appreciate when a waiter is honest about their menu because not everything on the menu is good. Gaido's one saving grace is that their food is excellent, once I got past the smell of cleaning supplies. I thought it was pricey, but prepared exactly as it should be. I knew what I wanted, but my waiter had made some great recommendations. I decided on having an appetizer of oysters on the half shell, a cup of gumbo and the red snapper with a lemon butter sauce. The oysters are what I expected since it's practically impossible to mess these up. The gumbo was very average, but the snapper was fantastic. Perfectly grilled with all of the moistness that fresh fish should have, and the flavors were intense and bursting with freshness.I'm hoping that they've ""cleaned up"" the smell in the place, but I haven't been back since due to the unappetizing memory it left. I would be willing to make another trip here, but I don't get down to Galveston as much as I would like to. This is probably a place worth coming to, but don't expect to have an affordable dining experience. This is one of the classier restaurants on the seawall, and the prices will remind you of that.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-https://www.yelp.com/biz/gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2?start=220,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,Scott S.,"Houston, TX",23,23,11,,3/7/15,"Suggested by a friend and I will thank her with a dinner when I see her again.

But........the Mahi Mahi was hideous. Truthfully the worst Mahi Mahi I had ever had in my life. It wasn't that it was not delicious or even tasteless, it really teally tasted bad. It was breaded. It was flattened. It had no flake. Oh! It was just terrible. We also shared a Brownie with icecream topping. It was delicious. Total $135.32 + 18.75 (15% tip) = $154.07 Subpar. Overpriced.

We really wanted to go to a great seafood restaurant, and had previously bought their cookbook at Murdoch's on a previous visit to Galveston. We hadn't tried any of the recipes in the book, so going to Gaido's to experience their food has definitely been something on our list for a while. We came in as a party of four, and were seated very quickly towards the back of the main dining room. The tables were set nicely and it looked like they were sort of trying to straddle the line between beach casual and fine dining. No matter, the place was nice enough and we were hungry. The decor is a little outdated, but not as bad as some places I have seen before. Our waiter was a newer employee, and incredibly enthusiastic. He explained the restaurant history, as well as gave us recommendations off the menu and was generally a pleasure. That being said, he was at some points way too chatty and over enthusiastic, definitely too casual for a restaurant that is trying to be a fine dining establishment. Towards the end of our two hour dinner adventure, we were getting pretty tired of his long drawn out explanations of why he was checking on our table, and he definitely made some missteps such as talking about his tip, explaining that he wasn't doing this by the employee manual and why, and in the beginning I think he judged us a little bit by our age and attire.Anyways, for our food, we ordered a pretty good array of things. My husband had the bisque to start out with and everyone in our party tried it. It was very good. My husband also ordered the stuffed flounder which he very much liked. Our friends ordered the premium gulf shrimp and the ahi tuna - and both of them were impressed by their entrees. I ordered the salmon, sapporito style with the crispy potato wedges. I think I made a little bit of a mistake ordering it sapporito style, (parmesan crusted). I couldn't really taste the salmon over the spices in the crusting. It was really good, but probably should not have been paired with the salmon. The waiter maybe could have guided me on that - I didn't think it would be a heavy breading. For dessert, my husband and I shared the pecan pie - which was divine. Seriously excellent, and one of the highlights of our meal. One of our friends had the Creme Brulee and she did enjoy it.The pricing was a little bit higher than what I thought the food was worth - but it wasn't really out of the ballpark of what I would have expected for a fine dining restaurant in a tourist town.So, to summarize we really could have had a better experience with service. It was a good experience but the waiter really needed to take himself down a few notches. In addition, if we were on vacation and not driving all the way back to Austin that evening, a two hour dinner experience wouldn't really have been an issue. That being said, we ended up leaving Galveston a lot later than expected and didn't get home until around midnight which was wearing on all of us. There wasn't really any reason why our dinner experience should have been two hours long. The food was good, and I would definitely be willing to go back to Gaido's to have that food experience, but on a day trip I'm just not sure that's going to be possible now that I know the time frame that I'll need. Three stars it is - Gaido's.. you're going to have to do improve on some things before you get two more stars from me.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-https://www.yelp.com/biz/gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2?start=240,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,Omeshi O.,"Dallas, TX",240,41,9,,11/8/15,Truly enjoyed our dinner here.

Now I know why.Our meal at Gaido's was without fault. They were able to seat all 11 of us, including two children, at a large table together. Our waiter was friendly and professional and everyone enjoyed their meal.I won't list everything we ordered, but between the whole family there weren't many things we left unsampled. The soups, seafood, salads, steaks, and cocktails were all 1st rate.

I ask his/her suggestions for the freshest GULF catch - just go with the flow! also, like almost all fish, there's good ways and bad ways to prepare it... (they have ~10 ways to cook any type of fish...Gaido's: scale that down!!)... what do you do? ask the chef! in most cases, it normally ends up looking like their daily special... whatever it may be, i hit a home run every time. So, dine here with an open mind, and just go with the flow. (last meal: blackened red snapper with jumbo lump crap topping... delicious!!)A word of advice to management - scale down the menu a bit, and stick with the resources right out the front window.. the gulf of mexico. scale back the 'preparations' guide, and offer a short list of suggestions PER the type of fish ordered!I'm rating them 3/5 stars - because i do believe that if it shows up on the menu, it should be top notch quality, and i don't need to dance around it in order to have a good experience.

I spent quite a bit of time looking at reviews and picking a place for dinner. I had picked a couple of different places, then found out they were Laundry's owned and we wanted a locally owned place, not a chain. Should've gone Laundry's. The ambiance was nice. The dining room is huge, we were seated right in the middle, but it didn't feel crowded, it wasn't bad. Our server was young, but knowledgeable about the menu. He told us the specials, but later I found those two items on the regular menu. Typically, 'specials' denotes something that is not on the regular menu, an item that was receives in fresh and only for a day or two, Otherwise it should be a ""featured"" item. As a former fine-dining server, I was disappointing to be misled this way. It's akin to pushing upcharges and hiding an automatic gratuity. We ordered the stuffed blue crab, calamari and seafood bisque as appetizers. They were all fantastic. The calamari was cooked to perfection. The bisque was rich and flavorful, absolutely fantastic. It did have bay shrimp in it, which felt amateurish to me, but set the par for the evening. My husband ordered a second beer that took 15 minutes to get to the table. My other companion ordered another glass of wine, and I switched to scotch on the rocks. By the time they got to the table, my ice was all but melted, leaving me with a glass of water with a faint scotch flavor. My companions ordered the tilefish and the mahi mahi. They both came crusted in cracker, you have to pay extra for a sauce to go on them. Extra to the tune of $9-$13 each. I was confused as to why you would put a cracker crust on fresh piece of fish. The flavor of fresh fish needs a simple preparation to be enhanced, not crusted and doused in sauce that covers the flavor. My husband ordered the filet. He loves steak, we were excited for a nice cut of texas beef. The meat was flavorful, but poorly cooked. He ordered it mid-rare. It came with a solid half inch on both sides cooked brown, with a inch of rare red in the center. The meat probably came right out of the fridge and was rush cooked. Possibly finished in the oven and left there to long. Not much of a sear on it at all. Regardless of where they went wrong, it was a poor way to treat a beautiful piece of meat. The only potato option was steak fries. He tried to order a baked potato but the server discouraged it because it was a huge 'side to share'. Look buddy, I can read, I see that on the menu, and if my husband wants a baked potato, he should be able to order one without any guff from you! And if he'd had a big potato to share, I might have at least had something to eat. I love seafood. LOVE it. Scallops are my kryptonite. I can't NOT order them if they are on a menu. I was pretty excited to try some great seafood at this Galveston seafood institution. I ordered the seafood combination. It came with shrimp, scallops and mahi mahi. I was served a mess of a plate on par with Red Lobster. Everything on the plate was sorely overcooked and over seasoned. The shrimp were butterflied, which we all know is a way to make small shrimp look bigger. These were probably 21-30 size shrimp. REALLY? The scallops were the smallest sea scallops I have every seen, possibly were jumbo bay scallops. The mahi mahi was a decent size filet. Everything was so over seasoned that my mouth was burning. The shrimp and scallops were rubbery, the fish was so dry and the edges so rubbery I couldn't cut through them with a fork. A FORK. For fish. So disappointing, I didn't have more than a bite or two of it. Desert was ice cream with raspberry sauce and a chocolate mouse. They were ok. Overall, I think this place has aspirations of being a fine dining restaurant, but falls very short, The service was clunky and uncomfortable, but could have been overlooked if the food was fantastic, which it was not. Our bill was $270 for 4 people. The wine and appetizers were nicely priced, the dinner entrees were grossly overpriced. We have no problem paying for a spectacular meal, but this felt like throwing money to the wind.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-https://www.yelp.com/biz/gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2?start=260,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,Jason B.,"Barker, TX",74,4,5,,7/10/16,Amazing restaurant and service!

I had eaten here once over a decade ago and it was one of the nicest and best tasting italian seafood restaurants i had ever had. Now its just an overpriced dump. I'd rather eat cold mcdonalds than go back.It was mardi gras in galveston and one of my relatives was also celebrating their birthday so i thought i would take him somewhere nice (and extremely well known) for dinner. The place wasnt too busy even though it was mardi gras and there was no line so we got a table easily without much trouble. However, we could hardly hear the waiter he barely spoke above a whisper. The seafood came after over half an hour and it was the blandest and most insipid and worn out looking thing i've seen for $$$. Mahi mahi and pretty much everything else looked like they microwaved leftovers and gave it to us. I wouldn't mind frozen fish sticks with heavy salt and msg right now because that would have tasted far better. The martinis were extremely bland with zero alcohol, the veggies were just undercooked crap tossed in some oil my dog could probably make. Our sides were hilariously small. Potato wedges? Have two! The entrees themselves were also pathetically small. Tartar sauce had zero flavor. Even the bread was depressingly bad. Old and dry like the expired supermarket stuff they hand out at church to the homeless. Our waiter continuously stumbled with words and service and remembering to bring things to us, and much of the other waiters looked careless and inexperienced and young as well. If there was a manager, i didnt see one.

It's super fancy but looks really dated. The menu doesn't cater to anyone who can't eat fish, there's not a simple chicken dish they're all more exotic in taste and sometimes a person just wants regular chicken. So my husband and sister were out of luck. The portion sizes were hilarious. My husband got a some cheese crusted chicken with potato wedges and he just got a pounded out chicken with 4 fries that cost like $20 and my dad, cousin, and my self got the famous fried platter which was $23 a person and it was really sad. You get like 4 fried shrimps and these little claw things that have zero meat on them and a little baby fish that is so fried that it's not really meat anymore. You can go to Red Lobster and get the admirals feast and get 60% more food on your plate for about $18. I was highly disappointed in the food here. The family sized Mac and cheese was a joke it's really only enough for a table of 4 to get half a spoon full (even tho it was good) when my dad got the ticket he joked and said ""dang who got the Mac and cheese!!"" I'm guessing it was even more expensive than my mom thought it'd be. But really it looked like $1.50 worth of Mac and cheese that probably cost $15 this place just burns a whole through your wallet and you still leave the place hungry. They give you dry bread for free but salads and stuff don't come with your dinners those are paid separately. You just don't get what you pay for.

We felt very uncomfortable after the horrible greeting from the hostess--Think her name was Shaniqua. She acted like she hated her job and was not happy at all to be there. She was sighing heavily and putting her hand over her face. I understand the frustration of people coming to eat before closing, but it's a business in a tourist town. There was even more people coming in behind us. We also ate and left fairly fast, by 9:30 or so. Even if you hate your job or hate the fact that people come in to your establishment 10 min before closing, don't take it out on the customers. You should put on a fake smile and be pleasant to start the night off on a good note for the guests. It goes a long way and can make the whole experience a lot better. Especially after spending $100 for two people. We expressed our complaint to the manager--Tim.

She really wanted us to know the options for the dishes, which are basically your choice of sides.The stuffed crab appetizer was good. My entree was a disappointment - some of the most non-crispy, limp fried shrimp I've ever had. I can get better shrimp in Dallas, in any number of places. Very disappointing, especially since people here and elsewhere had raved about the dish. Anyone who thinks those are the best fried shrimp anywhere has never been to Red Lobster, since theirs are better. The potato wedges were tasty. I added grilled scallops, and they were good, but nothing special.My wife had grilled scallops as an entree and she said they were fine, but one was a bit gritty. She didn't like the rice.My wife also tried the Shrimp Peques but didn't like the glaze. I tried one, and it's pretty sweet.

The charbroiled large gulf shrimp and scallops had a great grill taste and were large, fresh, and full of flavor, and we had the snapper with it, and, of course, I asked for the corn relish to be added. It was every bit as good as it always is.It was a culinary delight -- and believe me, we know and love seafood---as a professional entertainer (jazz pianist/singer) I've played all over the country and eaten in some swanky seafood places--The Cloister Hotel on Sea Island, the Grand Hotel on Mackinac, working cruises all over the world, playing Vegas, and for the last 6 years performing at the finest place in College Station -- Veritas Wine and Bistro--and upscale French-Asian fusion place who specializes in --- you guessed it -- seafood!! But here's what made this particular visit to Gaidos so memorable for us: After the meal I was browsing some of the old menus they have framed on the wall from years long gone, and an older waiter came over and started talking. I could tell by the tie he'd been here a long time---platinum. That's right, he said, 36 years. I asked his name and he told me Bill Meyers, ""Uncle Bill,"" they call him. We talked of the prices of old, and Gaidos of old, and the changes in recent years, with Casey now running Gaidos and what was Casey's is now Nicks (Ate there the night before---really beautiful patio and pool bar, very nicely remodeled).My wife, Margaret, asked Uncle Bill about the Pelican Club. For those of you unfamiliar, back in the day the Pelican Club was as fine a place as you'd ever find, it was THE upscale place in Galveston, for those who could afford it.But the Pelican Club has been closed to the public for years, but not anymore! Uncle Bill explained that it had been revived and is once again open to the public and even offerred us a tour (now, technically an after hours tour since they were closing). We opened the doors to the Pelican Club and stepped back in time. There it was in all its spendor, with all the tables beautifully set as if they were expecting Queen Elizabeth II and her party. The private dining rooms off the side were also set and ready to go. If you love old places full of history and character, the effect of the room was stunning. Sitting right in the middle of the room was a beautiful antique grand piano, and Uncle Bill said -- it's still in tune -- try it out. I played a few bars of ""As time Goes By"" and the security guard rushed in and Uncle Bill smiled and waved him off. Thanks for the guided tour, Uncle Bill, and for the personal experience you gave us. Our next party is going to be in the Pelican Club. Only next time I come, oysters will be in season, and I can't wait to get some of those oysters chargrilled in the half shell! Mmmm Mmmm Mmmmm","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-https://www.yelp.com/biz/gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2?start=320,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,Kaleb C.,"Austin, TX",0,4,,,8/8/14,"Here we go. A few friends and I decided to go to Gaidos because it seemed among the nicer places around Galveston. We're from Austin and heavily involved in the food industry there. From the moment we walked in we were greeted half-heartedly by the manager as if we were some group of cousins he really couldn't stand but had to be polite to at the family reunion. The hostess showed us to our seats and we were served by a waitress named Ruth. This is where things start going really down hill.We order cocktails and an appetizer, and when the cocktails took a little longer she started blaming the bartender for being too slow, which was odd. The cocktail by the way, the peach schnapps drink, tasted like a supermarket snow-cone with a 5 cent maraschino cherry. When it comes time to order I ask if the fried seafood plate can be made dairy free because I happen to be not only lactose intolerant, but allergic to all forms of dairy. I let her know that I'm allergic because being in the service industry, an allergy seems to be a bigger red flag on food awareness than an intolerance. Ruth laughs in my face and tells me it's fried, and that I'm better off going for something grilled. Taken extremely aback I ask if it is possible at all to fry something not in butter. She then tells me she'll check, which I appreciated. The service from this point was not relative to the prices. She gave me the all clear the platter was completely dairy free. We get our food, it looks presentable. Having been on the road for three and a half hours and starving, we dig in. Nothing remarkable about the cuisine, no surprises in flavor or texture that would make the food stand out. After being just about finished, I start feeling a pain in my chest, an itching in my ears, and a slight swelling in my throat. This wasn't something that I needed to go to the hospital for, but something that simply made me clearly, and uncomfortably aware that there was some form of dairy product in the dish that I had consumed. This was quite painful for me, something that would pass, yes, but I felt as if glue was pumping through my aorta and it became difficult to remain pleasant with a wait staff that preferred to argue with me and tell me that I was wrong, than to accommodate my needs as a customer. When Ruth returned, I let her know that there must have been some contamination. She shifted the blame to the kitchen saying that she wrote down all that she needed to write down to get a dairy free dish, she took no responsibility for what had happened and started asking me my symptoms as if I was lying about the ordeal I was going through. When I started to tell her I had a pain in my chest she then interrupted me before I could finish my sentence to tell me that it's just an intolerance. Then she asked me if I had a benadryl, as if I was responsible for the allergic reaction and that I should fix it. I'm not sure if she's had much medical practice, but my doctor would tend to disagree. The attitude was not that of a service minded establishment, but one of arrogance and pride which does not belong on a dining room floor. At this point I was very upset, this has been the worst dining experience of my life. I asked another server who was helping our table (who was attentive and helpful) to see the manager. I was not planning on paying for my allergic reaction. Soon after she came to the table to ask us who had wanted to see the manager, which was frankly intrusive and inappropriate. I spoke up, being as frustrated as I was, and she responded, ""oh it was you, wasn't it."" She brought out our separated checks, trying to take my money before I could solve this issue on my own. All before the manager arrived she took my companions bills but I held on to mine as she reached for it. When the GM came to the table I explained to him the situation and he took care of the bill. He was very straight forward and apologetic. I won't eat at Gaido's again, I won't recommend it to anyone, and I wrote this review for a reason. I understand the impact upon which something like this can have and I also understand that it can be a catalyst for improvement. My service was horrendous, fraught with inability to take responsibility and problem solving.In conclusion, don't go, unless you have no expectations of service standards and want to spend a lot of money on the appearance of quality.","alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-https://www.yelp.com/biz/gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2?start=320,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,Rachel G.,"Denison, TX",0,13,,,3/9/16,"This place really wants to be fancy but it falls short.

We were greeted by a not-so-nice hostess upon entering, which is forgivable- everybody has a bad day, right? But as the hostess walked us to our table, we were greeted with the stinky musk of the dining room carpet. Who has carpet in restaurants anymore? And we all smelled the mix of mildew and I don't even know what throughout the entire meal (even my 73 year old grandmother whose nose doesn't work like it used to). That was the first sign that we should have left. Then I made the mistake of looking up! The (very low) ceiling was covered in a layer of dust and all of the ceiling fans and lanterns had a THICK layer of dust on them. Not to mention some of the fans were running, so I felt like the dust was just spreading around and landing on us. I don't know about you but that is just not appetizing. Then we opened the menu and were horrified with how expensive it was. Especially looking at the state (and smell) of the restaurant. Then we ordered the goat cheese beignets- that was a mistake. Not awful, but most definitely would not order them again. We all ordered and when the food arrived my plate was dirty and old looking. Lovely. All of our blue cheese wedge salads were less than desirable ($9 a pop) with the watery ""dressing"". My brothers grilled seafood combo was cold and not fresh. Our soup was hot but sloppily plated- and I might add it cooled down quickly because of the dust blowing fan above our table. So to give it one last honest try we ordered dessert. No one can screw up dessert... right? Wrong again! We ordered the brownie-a-la-mode, and it was more like an icing-less chocolate cake with a small plop of ice cream on top. So that was very disappointing. The only positive thing I can say is that our waiter was pleasant- not extremely nice, but pleasant. (Especially compared to the snooty hostess!) But really, that's it. There were SO many people working and hustling and bustling around us (including men wearing suits with microphones hooked to their ears) and I couldn't help but think... Out of the 50 staff they have working today, not one of them could clean and dust a little bit? Just maybe? Wishful thinking. What concerns me most is that they let their guests eat in a dining room that's in a terrible state... If their dining room, something that guests can see, looks like this I don't even want to imagine what shape the kitchen is in.

My friend doesn't eat seafood so she ordered the ribeye steak, which was tender and flavorful. The service was good, although our waiter seemed inexperienced and unsure about some of the menu items. My only real complaint about Gaido's is that it seems overpriced for what you get. The drinks are very expensive (my rum drink, while very tasty, was $10, so I only had one). The $36 steak came with only one side, and the selection was not impressive, so my friend ordered an extra side (asparagus, which was tough and overcooked, in addition to the parmesan-topped tomatoes that came with her steak, which were excellent), and we ordered a salad to share, which added a considerable amount to the bill. Overall, it was a mixed experience. I'm glad we ""checked in"" here again after several years, but it may be another several years before we go back.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-https://www.yelp.com/biz/gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2?start=340,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,Tyler Daniel R.,"Houston, TX",193,2,1,,12/14/13,"If Mediocre was a flavor. The seafood was found wanting.

This was my wife's and my first visit to Gaido's which is a family owned, elegant Galveston restaurant. It has been in business over 100 years. The dining room is elegant as it sits on Seawall Blvd, with a reasonable view of the Gulf.The meal started out quite well. We ordered a Mojito and Peach Bellini, both of which were quite good, though pricey (~$10/ea). As an appetizer we split a bowl of the Shrimp Bisque, and it, along with the bread, were both also excellent.Then the experience went very bad, very quickly. First my wife eats very little actual fish beyond Salmon, and there was fresh Salmon on the menu. She decided to order the Seafood combo, which came with three choices of fish, none of which were Salmon ($22-$25). So we requested a substitute, which, our relatively new wait person thought was routine. A few minutes later our waitperson and the head waiter appeared at our table apologizing saying they ""Can't substitute."" I asked if they had Salmon, they said yes, so I said, ""Please just substitute the Salmon and charge me $30"" I figured even though Salmon was less expensive than other fish on the menu, 30% more for the bill was reasonable. They replied ""No, we can't do that."" When I asked further, it was some sort of restaurant policy. This irritated me, particularly when they use the word ""can't"" so I got in a tiff with the head waiter that they ""Chose"" not to do it, however they were perfectly ""capable"" of substituting. After a couple of rounds of arguing, they finally partially conceded, really just to shut an aggravated customer up.My wife then ordered a fried shrimp of some sort, and I ordered shrimp gumbo. When the entrees arrived, my gumbo was good and had ~8 small shrimp. My wife peeled open one of her shrimp... and it was not deveined. Please keep in mind this is an elegant restaurant with $20 entrees. Also, please understand that ""deveined"" is not really taking a vein out, it is taking out the bowel of the shrimp. So, unless you prefer to quite literally eat shrimp poop, it is pretty important.We were both surprised, and I started looking at my shrimp, which had tasted normal. When I pulled them out and cleaned them off, 1/2 were deveined and 1/2 were not. This, to me, was shocking. The restaurant obviously knew to devein and the fact that 1/2 of mine were not simply meant someone was not doing their job, or the quality control was off. The manager agreed to take the two entrees off, and we paid our bill (~$28 for two drinks and a bowl of Bisque) and leave.I don't think it would be possible to talk my wife into going back. The atmosphere was very nice and the service from our wait staff was great. However the weirdness about the Salmon substitution for Tuna (why in the world would you opt not to grant a simple request to a customer that was willing to pay... this is like rule #1 of customer service) and the, quite literally, full of *hit shrimp made for a pretty bad dining experience.","alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-https://www.yelp.com/biz/gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2?start=360,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,Clark F.,"Austin, TX",0,11,1,,6/14/14,"As Jerry Seinfeld says of car rental agencies, ""they know how to TAKE the reservations..they just don't know how to HOLD the reservations.""youtube.com/watch?v=A7uv…We made a booking via OpenTable well in advance. We showed up on time (7pm) and checked in with the hostess at the front desk, giving her our name. She told us to have a seat in the waiting area and we would be called as soon as our table was ready. Well we waited and waited, watching other people be seated, and assuming they had reservations ahead of us. Finally, after an hour, we were running out of patience and asked the hostess by the dining area (not the one at the front door) how much longer it would be. She went a bit red faced and realized our reservation had somehow disappeared from their system. She was reasonably apologetic (apparently most of the staff does not have English as a first language, which is fine) and seated us immediately.We then were shortly greeted by a very friendly waitress who took our order, as by this point with our three year old son the clock was ticking and we were running out of time. (Fortunately he was brilliant during the whole ordeal.) One of the appetizers (the craw fish fondue) arrived within a few minutes, but inexplicably another (the shrimp cocktail) did not arrive with it. After about ten minutes we asked our waitress about the second appetizer and apparently she had assumed we wanted it with our mains. Odd. We told her we had wanted it as an appetizer and she said she would retrieve it presently. Anyway we all shared the fondue which was tasty and very rich, with a decent amount of craw fish. I proceeded to take a look around for ""dust on the ceiling fans"" as another Yelper has noted and couldn't understand how anyone could have possibly had eyes sharp enough to see this. The place seemed clean enough, if a bit old-fashioned in a kitschy way that seemed potentially charming to us. Finally, another full hour after we had been seated, all of the food arrived at once, including the shrimp cocktail appetizer, which by this point seemed a bit superfluous. The (blackened) combination platter with tile (which was the day's fresh catch) was very good; the scallops were decent though not by any stretch the best I've had as they were slightly stringy and overcooked, the shrimp were very tasty but had a faint chemical flavor, the tile was indeed excellent. The rice was actually outstanding, as were the Parmesan tomatoes. The grilled prawns were good and the crab cakes were (in our non-expert opinion) excellent. The bill was about $107 for three-and-a-half of us, which seemed fairly reasonable to us for seafood in a city.All in all a fairly decent seafood dinner tarnished by slow and fumbling service.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-https://www.yelp.com/biz/gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2?start=360,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,Shirley A.,"Belton, TX",29,75,17,,5/5/14,"There was a time this would have rated a five star, those days are gone.

Ocean views, crisp white tablecloths and linens, candlelight, and servers in tuxedo vests and bow-ties - very nice. The food however is a completely different story. Well I will amend that statement by saying that the entrees are nothing special. The Salads and appetizers are worth wild. But after the starters on the menu is where the buck stops. My last visit was with my family and both my parents being solid Gaidos fans, even had to agree that it just was plain bad. The entrees were cold, the fish tasted like the sea (fishy and not in a good way) and the finishing sauces that you choose to compliment your cut of fish were all versions of the same thing, butter flour, cream, cheese. Not very creative or flavorful. The service was good, but not great. Our server was trying to be smooth and it was just coming off as overly arrogant. He spoke to us about his favorite entrees, and appetizers selling them to us only to further find out that they were out of them for the evening...weird. I was kept waiting until the end of my appetizer to receive my glass of wine that I had ordered immediately upon my arrival. And then he forgot about the tables coffee orders, which at that point no one really cared about, we just wanted to get out. The food and service is way over priced for what it is, which is a shame because it could be revamped by a few tweaks to the menu. My picks: ~Jazz Martini - its absolutely massive and nicely paired with lime, avocado and cocktail sauce at the bottom of the martini glass that the jumbo shrimp are displayed in. It is HUGE and can eat like a meal. ~ Soup Trio Lobster bisque, gumbo and soup of the day Nice sampling, delicious ~Wedge Salad Iceberg Lettuce ""Wedge"" with Crumbled Bacon, Diced Tomato, Purple Onion and homemade Chunky Bleu Cheese - LOVE the textures and colors of this salad.

The Admiral's entitles you to a full entree plus the soup/salad and dessert for $9. I went with the Captain's portion, and tried to order some entrees but each time was told ""That's not part of the Captain's."" Ok.... So I went with the stuffed shrimp. Our server suggested the stuffed shrimp instead of the shrimp carbonara.Next time I'm listening to my own advice. The shrimp were overly breaded. Kind of like a hush puppy on a shrimp.My husband had the snapper, cooked to perfection. Flaky, tasty, but not at all how it was described. Something about a Parmesan crust, which did not seem to manifest itself at all. Dishes tend to be less than aesthetically appealing when it comes to presentation. A few spears of asparagus tried to gussy up the plate to no avail.I had the pecan pie for dessert, my husband has the crème brulee. Good, not great. Next time we stop in Galveston, I'm glad Gaido's has been crossed off our list because I don't plan to come back. As we left we noticed the restaurant was overflowing. So if you do decide to come, come early.As we left the restaurant, I couldn't help but sing Public Enemy in my head....

A few small shrimp does not count as seafood! The crawfish fondue is a bowl of strong flavoring crawfish in an orange cheese sauce, we do not recommend this! The snapper came out in fillets, no explanation or apology. It was good. The blackened shrimp were okay and the ravioli should have been on the menu as a chicken breast with a side of ravioliThe kids were sold on dessert. The chocolate cake was amazingly light and very rich. All in all very pricey for a meal we could have had at red lobster for less $$$Bathrooms need a little upgrading.

Meanwhile, every table by the windows was seated within 15 minutes. Hmmm..go figure. no tables by the window .NOT RIGHT NOW. The food was forgettable. I was warned by the waitress not to touch my plate because it was so hot. The plate was hot. The food was not. The grilled food ordered by my husband tasted like Kingsford lighter fluid.

The crabs were only fair, and came with two stalks of asparagus. I don't recall the price, but it seems they were around $22, which isn't a bad price at all for good soft-shell crabs.

If this place had a heyday, it certainly isn't now. I've lived in Houston for 40 years but never got around to trying Gaido's. I finally tried it last Saturday night and could not have been more disappointed. For the price we paid, we all felt robbed. This place is ridiculously overpriced for what you get and the quality of food. We ordered a dozen raw oysters to start. They were small and had very little oyster meat in them. That wasn't worth $20. I ordered stuffed shrimp and it was mediocre and nothing that made me think it's any better than another seafood restaurant. The most egregious crime of the night was my wife's snapper. This entrée costs $31 and she got a topping that was $12. The snapper was lightly fried and didn't look good. It looked like something you'd see in a Luby's window. The snapper wasn't white or flaky like snapper is supposed to be which makes me suspect that it wasn't snapper-frying fish covers up a lot. Then they threw on the Fritz topping which looked terrible. The color was a brownish green that was similar to guacamole that's been sitting out too long. It wasn't very good. It's basically garlic butter with crab meat and peppers in it and wasn't worth $12. So my wife's fish costs $43, more than a good filet mignon and wasn't even close to meeting expectation. We also ordered the potatoes au gratin. This needed help too. Not sure what kind of cheeses they use but it wasn't a sharp tasting cheese but rather mild. It needed salt! The bread crumps on it looked like they took the entrée out of the oven too soon. It's hard to screw up potatoes au gratin but they did. My friend ordered the lobster bisque and it wad mediocre as well. Our server was named Amber and she was sweet but very slow on the service. All told, we walked out of here feeling disappointed and robbed. The food is not worth the price. It's much worse than any of the Pappas's restaurants and they're a chain. But at least you get value at those places and their seafood is 10x time better.

I LOVE seafood, I remember loving it the last time I was there and was looking forward to going.We got there late afternoon before the dinner rush so it was nice and quiet, got seated promptly. They brought out our drinks and some bread and dipping oil. The bread was cold and on the staler side. The dipping oil was bland like dipping it in to cooking oil. Next came the appetizers and I got the seafood gumbo along with my parents, my brother got the bisque. The gumbo was supposed to be the chef's speciality if memory serves from reading the menu. Bland bland bland and they used the small tiny frozen shrimp you buy at H.E.B. in the big bags for like $5. PATHETIC. According to my brother, the bisque was ok but nothing special.So while waiting quite a long time considering we were only of only three tables in the entire place, the hi-lite of the experience was getting to see some giant black guy manager proceed to hit on the table of three women next to us. Wouldn't even leave them alone to look over the menu. Literally stood there for 25 minutes from the time they sat down, going over everything he could come up with to keep talking to them. You could see the smoke coming from his ears as his mind did all it could to come up with something to say to keep him there. I was waiting for him to just give them the key to a hotel room.Finally got our food and was instantly unimpressed. I got the seafood platter. Consisted of shrimp, scallops, one small piece of fish and a bunch of small brown/gray balls that are called stuffing balls and I believe a bunch of fries. The shrimp were just ok, and only slightly larger than the min-shrimps we got in the gumbo. NOTE to restaurants, ""butterflying"" your shimp does not actually make them larger. The scallops were probably the best part of the meal sadly. The catfish was small, dry and I could have used it as a table to write a novel on. Pathetic. The stuffing balls literally tasted like charred chalk balls. Absolutely NO taste. There was something in them, as I cut one open and there was something in there, I just don't know what it was supposed to be. Aside from the food, the overall experience was good, the wait staff were very nice and attentive, our server had a personality and was enjoyable to deal with. The decor was nice, still had pix up from the last time I was there many years ago, but things like that don't matter to me. Its a historical Galveston landmark, so to see the food so horrible was really a shame.

The grits and shrimp may end up on my ""Crave This Food"" list! But there were a couple of disappointments that surprised us. The cocktail my colleague ordered went largely untouched. The waiter noticed, but never asked what was wrong with it. The olives in it had a slice of cheese stuffed in them, but nothing gooey and melty that you'd expect at that price point. The brownie cake we had for dessert was a bit of a disappointment, as well, not what we were expecting. Again, largely untouched and the waiter didn't ask any questions. Coffee was okay, but more warm than hot. I guess for a nearly $100 lunch (with appetizers), I expected a bit more.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-https://www.yelp.com/biz/gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2?start=400,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,Paul M.,"Austin, TX",3,76,81,,7/8/12,"I'm giving Gaido's 3 Stars because this place has great food and great service. Wait staff is properly trained, seafood is good quality with fresh garnishments, and homemade sauces. Wine selection could use some work as well as the ambiance.

We get there 5 minutes early. Hostess was a bit snippy. I just tell her my name and say yes I do have a reservation. Then 20 minutes later my husband goes to check on our table. She goes off on him and says they are working on it. no table available. We have a reservation. We sit for 5 more minutes and he goes into the dinning room. There are tables all over the place for 6 people. The hostess comes over to apologize i guess but it didn't go like that she was once again rude as hell. I was ready to leave but the manager finally puts a table together and we are starving. Thank goodness we had a wonderful waiter. He was very helpful with choosing some very yummy options for our dinner.

I heard about it in Spain and again in France while travelling during the 80""s. I was mentioned both times as one of the best seafood restaurants in the world. I finally ate at Gaido's in 2003. It was as good as I was told. Most interesting were the fresh shrimp laid out on a platter peeled and cut square so each fit flush against the next. They were served on a platter of a strange metal that was chilled to almost freezing that stayed near that temperature while I was eating. I went before it was busy. Service was superb. I found that the family was cooking in Galveston before the great hurricane of the 1800's and it is still in business. Unbelievable. Chefs in other restaurants know about it and even rate it as the best. All dishes I've tried have been perfect and near traditional. A couple of years after trying it I heard about it on TV when a chef with a cooking show mentioned it as one of the best. I think it was the galloping gourmet who rarely raved about a place unless he was toasted. He was dry and sober and he still gave it a rave review. I now will go and try it again whenever I am in Houston. I hope the new reviews aren't indicative of another problem or from the competition from Houston's Kima restaurants which I hated in comparison.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-https://www.yelp.com/biz/gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2?start=400,gaidos-seafood-restaurant-galveston-2,Heidi C.,"Keller, TX",2,23,,,2/28/15,My husband and I eat here every time we have come to Galveston. Not only is the service top notch but the food is amazing. Some of the reviews may say it is over priced but when you order fish and they bring out the ENTIRE fish cooked with additional seafood toppings it is certainly NOT over priced. The food is super fresh and perfectly seasoned. They will even cater to your specifications if you want.

We came around 8:30pm on 04/25/15 we didn't have the reservation but we asked the host to see whether they still accepted the customers and how long do we have to wait. He said yes, they still accept customer and the waiting list will be around 30 mins. We agreed to put our name on the list, we sat down and waited for 50 mins, no one came to ask us if we need anything, I finally asked the host again about the waiting list.

I hadn't been back in over twenty years and was eagerly anticipating taking my family to the place that I loved as a child/teen. I was also a little concerned that it wouldn't be as good as I remembered. Thankfully, that was not at all an issue.First, walking into Gaido's is like taking a step back in time. The walls are covered with photographs of the family and the city from the past. There are cases of cut-glass dishes and pitchers that remind you of the elegance of past eras. The servers still dress in black slacks, white shirt and vests. The tablecloths are pressed white linens.However, the clientele is dressed from casual (khaki shorts and t-shirts) to ""nice""(Dockers and button-downs), so don't be afraid to try this place out if you didn't bring dressy clothes.The food met and exceeded my expectations. My son and I both ordered the Mahi-mahi special with a crab topping. It was cooked perfectly. My husband had the red snapper with crab and my father-in-law ordered the lump crab. None of us had a bite left on our plates. For dessert, we ordered their ""best in the state""Pecan pie and it did NOT disappoint. We might return to Galveston just to eat here again.
