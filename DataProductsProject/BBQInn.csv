I recently went here June 2017 and Guess what?!?!? UPDATES have been made. So that alone screams update your review. The first thing that I noticed is that they now have hot sauce- Louisana hot sauce!!! Woohhooo! Also new chairs, and they are comfy. I also noticed that the bring out a condiment tiered tree style thing that consisted of chives, cheese, and butter when you order a baked potato. Service was great and the fried chicken was AWESOME especially with the hot sauce on it.I'll be back and will check for any other updated changes!","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,barbecue-inn-houston,barbecue-inn-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/barbecue-inn-houston?start=0,Rex C.,"Houston, TX",68,407,791,Elite ’17,1/6/17,"Wow yelper Garett B says this place is better than willie maes scotch house in New Orleans. First off garret you are wrong! Second the fried chicken here is flavorless! My god if you have been to willie maes in New Orleans and have been to bbq inn please inbox me and tell me which one was better 16 bucks for some very flavorless fried chicken. I mean it has no flavor. I guess the people that rant and rave about this place like over price bland chicken. This is truly one of those places that are hyped up and it does not deliver. I wish my old B4ueat review on this place was up. Too bad the site closed. I had some really good reviews on there. Seriously though to the people that love this place please message me and tell me what I am missing. The food is so bland. No flavor at all. No lie Popeyes chicken is a lot better. I guess if you like overpriced bland chicken give this place a try. I will probably go back for their chicken fried steak. I really hate giving 1 star reviews but this chicken is not great and over priced.I went back to try the chicken fried steak with my new yelp friend Eddie S. He does epic reviews on here. and I have to say it was bland lol but very fresh! I dumped some cheese on it which gave it a lot of flavor. Service is great. People are very friendly. The owner is there watching over things. Had to give it a few more stars Bc the service is great. Really nice people.Also side the the half portion of chicken fried steak is tiny!

It is like stepping back in time, almost like a themed dinner. The waitresses wear these little Mary Poppin's uniforms and the place looks like it hasn't receive any type of renovations for over 30 years. The majority of clientele also seem to be the original authentic customers of the yester years. Lets call it ""Classic or Retro"". As far as the food, it is OK food but it's not anything extraordinary. It is certainly Majorly over priced. The menu is very limited with not many options. The ribs are tasty (but not any better than any other BBQ chain & $12 for 6 pieces of rib, no sides, and not baby-back) & the fried chicken has a nice crispy crunchy skin, but it is bland ($14 for a 3 piece w/ fries + salad) . There is no seasoning on anything. I had the fried fish once and it had that gray membrane stuff in it that made it taste really ""wild/gamey"". There are not many choices for sides either. You are limited to Baked Beans, Potato Salad, French Fries, Baked Potato) The $14 chicken fried steak was pretty decent, but again served with Fries.. (Never heard of Chicken Fried Steak not served with Mashed potatoes). This is just a place a co-worker of mine insists we stop in at when we go to Fling Saucer to pickup pies for work. I totally say pop in once just to say you've been there, but I doubt anything will have you coming back for more.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,barbecue-inn-houston,barbecue-inn-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/barbecue-inn-houston?start=0,Cameron K.,"Houston, TX",109,362,243,Elite ’17,5/7/17,"Been coming here for years.

So after a round of golf we are starving, John says let's do BBQ Inn, I am driving and ask what and where is this BBQ Inn place. He then explains that it's more or less a heavenly location where the universe just simply meets up and everything comes together. I am thinking it's just another BBQ place in Houston serving up dry meat cooked the night before.I have never been more wrong in my life and that includes the famed Vegas trip of 2001.I call my awesome veggie wife to ask if she wants to join us, I get the monotone ""no"". The same ""no"" I got when I thought it was a good idea to purchase a Porsche.So she is out.We walk in and are greeted by a super friendly staff. I mean it was like walking into the family drug store on Main Street in San Marcos back in the 80's.We are seated and I look at the menu and all the food walking by on its way to customers with huge smiles on there faces.John tells me the shrimp are incredible. So we go nuts, order shrimp, clams, ribs and just a ton of stuff. The waitress is perfect, offering to customize the order and offering all sorts of help. You just don't find this sort of thing inside the beltway.Next thing you know she is off with our crazy order and we are talking to the customers eating and having a great time, so yes it's like like a small town experience. Again you forget your in Houston.The food arrives and it looks pretty good. We dig in and everyone is looking at me waiting for my reaction. It's priceless, I break out into a huge grin and this weird noise comes out of the left side of my mouth.This stuff is good. The meat is tender and super tasty. The shrimp and clams are like I am back in Seattle at Pikes Place Market. Then I try the tarter sauce, holy crap, I mean HOLY CRAP!!!! Not sure if it has crack in it as it's so addicting. Again I have not had this since Seattle.So yes I am in heaven and wondering why I have not been here yet. But of course the answer is there is no veggie friendly items on the menu. Zero.But I don't care as again this is some of the best BBQ I have had. The staff and customers are great.So swing by, yes I guess I am the only one that has not heard of it or been there but now that I know about BBQ Inn you can count on me in.Love it","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,barbecue-inn-houston,barbecue-inn-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/barbecue-inn-houston?start=0,Frankie H.,"Houston, TX",6,94,,Elite ’17,8/5/17,"So I've driven by this place for many years and wanted to try it but really didn't seem to be very inviting. I recently had someone tell me they have really good food so my coworkers and I decided to try it. I ordered child's chicken plate (2 piece chicken and fries $10) and BBQ rib appetizer (4 short ribs $8). First the food is over priced. Second the BBQ is tasteless and is lacking a BBQ smell and so is the BBQ sauce. The staff is dressed in an old style waiter uniform and the decor is outdated. Now the place is clean the waiters are attentive and the chicken is great. Another member in our party had the brisket and said it too was tasteless she didn't eat it all, the beans were sweet and the fish was nothing to brag about. We noticed most of the patrons had chicken so maybe the name should be Chicken Inn because out of everything we ordered the fried chicken was the best.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,barbecue-inn-houston,barbecue-inn-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/barbecue-inn-houston?start=0,Eddie S.,"Houston, TX",248,843,8839,Elite ’17,1/12/17,"First thing is first, don't be a knucklehead like me and come here on a Monday when it is closed. I went against my Yelp format and did not bother looking at the opening and closing time, I assumed so you know what that spells out.Ok folks, I've been challenged by a new Yelp friend, Rex to try out this place and to see if I understand what all the hype is about with the chicken. Well Mr. Rex, this buds for you.This place gets filled up during lunch so you might want to get here before the lunch crowd as far as parking and the tables.When you first walk in you think about Mel's Diner and begin to look for Alice. If you take a few steps more, you will think you've been transported into a Luby's Cafeteria what without the cafeteria type food bar. This is a neighborhood restaurant that has most likely been here for awhile like when your grandparents were in diapers. I would say your average clientele here would be in their forties and fifties so most likely you will not have to worry about gang fights breaking out here or pandemonium except for Mertil and Gretched bickering about how Mary Lou should be planting her garden. Service, the owner or whoever is in charge of that department really picked them out well, these people or should I say ladies are very seasoned and well-versed on how to take care of customers. I swear that some of them must have been really good food hops when Sonic was bustling a long long time ago. Professional but not obtrusive but prompt and witty, you really do not find this type of service around very often.Now, the thing that Rex sent me to try. When you look at the menu prices for the Fried Chicken plates, you will notice that they are in the neighborhood of $15, what the hell? This better be good you tell yourself so when you order this also be advised that they make this fresh, expect to wait around 20 to 25 minutes. You are not here for fast food so calm yourself and enjoy the salad and cracker basket that is presented to you while you wait. I must have caught them on an off-day with their homemade dressing because it was kind of salty but I can tell you one thing, they give you plenty of it. A lot of people do not like their salad drowned in ranch dressing, I however, like mine wet so it sits well with me. Do not expect an extravagant chef salad but you will get a nice 8-inch plate of iceberg lettuce cut up with a couple of tomatoes to start off with.About 20 minutes later my chicken finally arrives, it is piping hot, so do not dig into your chicken until it's cooled off a couple of minutes or you might be sorry. They got the batter part right, it's like a really high-pitched crackling the first bites and that's pretty much is the only enjoyment there for me. When did people say that it is bland, they were not lying. This is nothing that a little salt and pepper can take care of but that's besides the point because you are waiting for something savory, but at least you have something fresh and crispy. Remember that pretty salty ranch dressing I was mentioning earlier? Well I kind of dipped the chicken pieces and in a little bit of that and it balanced it out well. The French fries that came with the chicken, I would not really recommend because it seems to have a burnt, old oil taste like the oil that it was Friday and was passed it's changing schedule.That being tried by me, but I pay $15 for another round of chicken plate here? Definitely not but the waitress was nice enough to allow me to order the 2 piece off of the kid's menu, now that's service. They did not lose $5 off of an adult chicken order-by letting me order the $10 kid's chicken plate, but they won somebody that will come back and try the chicken-fried steak and probably bring company as well, so do you see how that works? Take care of your customers and your customers will always come back and take care of you. That is the secret of why this place is always busy.Service, relaxed ambiance and the freshness of the food is what gives this place a good boost. My recommendation to them is to marinate the chicken in something at least the day before. This advice is coming from somebody that used to season the chicken at Popeye's as his first job and you see how that works right?There are a lot of good comfort food items on the menu so do not let the chicken review deter you. The menu is kind of pricey but it does not affect the clientele so they are doing something right since 1946.There you go Mr. Rex, the first Yelp friend I have ever dedicated a review to.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,barbecue-inn-houston,barbecue-inn-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/barbecue-inn-houston?start=0,Laura B.,"Pearland, TX",58,14,,,10/21/17,"It's hard to find really good friend chicken at restaurants anymore.

Even more so, Barbecue Inn was actually the first fried chicken joint being featured in the list. Of course I had to look this place up, right? I'm even more surprised that I'd driven by this place many times due to its close proximity to my work place but never gave it a second look due to the dated look of the restaurant.I made it out here for lunch to try their fried chicken to see what the hell Thrillist was talking about. I walked in here and saw that the interior was as dated as the outside. However, there was no wait because the restaurant was pretty much empty, and I was told that I could sit anywhere I please. I decided to sit at the bar since I was dining by myself and service at the bar is typically faster than having to wait a waitstaff coming to my table to help me.I ordered the fried chicken; and of course, as usual, I ordered white meats only - two breasts and a wing. The fried chicken comes with fries and a bowl of salad so I asked for Ranch dressing. According to the waitress who was serving me, they made their ranch and thousand islands dressing in house. The salad came out quick. However, the salad dressing didn't taste anything special to me; it tasted just like your typical ranch dressing.The fried chicken came out soon after and let me tell you this, they were pretty good sized. I can usually eat two breasts and two wings from any chicken joint in one sitting. Here, however, I wasn't able to finish my chicken. Maybe it was due to the fact that they also gave me a good portion of fries.As for the flavor, it's a good old fried chicken. II thought the chicken could use more seasoning, though. I love my fried chicken with some spice in it. Gus's fried chicken in Tennessee is an example of deliciously spiced fried chicken (#5 in the list above). I would say that the chicken is pretty comparable with the chicken from Max's Wine & Dive - juicy and awesome batter. I'm pretty much in agreement with Paul D.'s assessment.My service was pretty good overall. Until it was time to pay. My waitress disappeared. As a matter of fact, all the waitresses disappeared from behind the bar. Not sure what happened. I just flagged a different waitress and paid at the cashier.Although the name of the restaurant is Barbecue Inn, I don't think I'll ever come here to try the BBQ since Gatlin's is so much closer to me so I can't comment on that. I will, however, come back here to try the chicken fried steak.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,barbecue-inn-houston,barbecue-inn-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/barbecue-inn-houston?start=0,Tina D.,"Houston, TX",5,33,43,,10/28/17,"I am mixed on this place. It is straight up old school food. For those low carb/healthy people out there this is not the place for you! Smile. The salads are just iceburg lettuce and chopped tomatoes. The cracker basket has an assortment of crackers so the melba toast works great as a ""crouton"" broken up. My husband had the chicken fried steak and sub'd a baked potato. It did not seem to be the frozen stuff and was a thick cut compared to some chicken fried steaks out there that are pounded thin. I had the fried shrimp and ""stuffed"" crab and also sub'd a baked potato. Shrimp were good however the tartar sauce was super sweet and garlic heavy so that aspect could use some improvement. The stuffed crab we had a giggle fit on. The ""shell"" is a piece of foil kind of shaped like a crab shell. No flavor to it so I would pass on that altogether. The baked potatoes were cooked to perfection and a nice perk was they brought all the sides in a little cup station where you could put extra cheese if you so choose and I did indeed so choose extra cheese. No bacon as an option though but did have butter already on it and then choices of sour cream, cheese and fresh green onion slices. The sweet tea was strong and on point. Overall straight up old school american menu. We went at 5:15pm on a Saturday and very surprising that they had a full parking lot but plenty of seating still available. When we looked around we were greeted by a lot of grey hair so we understood the early crowd. I guess we are getting old since we keep hitting that crowd...LOL (we are 48).

Everything fried just perfectly. I have not ventured to the other food yet, still order the same thing after all these years, but hear it is really good as well. One of my other things I love are the little condiment carts they sit on your table for baked potatoes and such. It allows you to use as much or as little of a condiment as you need. Only place I have ever seen this setup. Note for To Go orders: Love their boxes!! Anytime I ordered fried fish somewhere, it would be soggy by the time I got home.

Walking in is like going back in time. There is a counter with stools, and cushy red booths lined everywhere. Plates clanking, and a dull conversation roar. Everyone from that old couple married for over 50 years (that have been coming here almost just as long) to families just starting out and bringing the next generation of fans in will visit. You really get the Pleasantville vibes here. It is always full, but not so much that there is no parking or no seats available. At least on the weekends. Service is as friendly and quick as can be.It has been a long, long time since my last visit. Good to see nothing has changed. Southern fried half chicken will feed you for an entire day. You get the salad first, which is just a big bowl of lettuce and tomato with a mountain of dressing. The trick is to continue adding crackers from the basket to the salad. Unremarkable otherwise, but what you going to do? That is the way they have served the salad for decades. The chicken is piping hot, it comes to the table probably hotter than any other fried chicken in town. Not that the spices are intense at all, just incredibly hot temp wise. The batter is fantastic though, and really juicy. I would say the BBQ is a little better than Goode Company, but certainly far from the new big four (obviously when considering the life of this place they are all new).Thats it, unpretentious, unchanged by time, and an underrated gem in the Independence Heights area.

Not only did the place look old, but all their customers were old as well. I'm talking about white hair old! And the fact that my girlfriend and I were the only Asians among the sea of Caucasian seniors did not soften the amount of glares that were turned on us as we strolled in the door. So I ordered the famous fried chicken, and my gf decided to try out the chicken fried steak. I was told that there would be at least a 15 minute wait, which I had no problem with. It meant that my friend chicken would be cooked fresh. And indeed it was so fresh and hot that it burned my mouth (a habit I need to get rid of from being so anxious to eat -.-) Although the skin was very crispy and the meat tender and juicy, it was too salty for my taste.

She was a very sweet and fun waitress. At first glance around the historic establishment, I thought I was on the set of a ""Cocoon"" movie reboot or a nursing home day room. They must have a hell of a seniors discount. It was cool though, as I really like the set up here. Of course I ordered the Fried Chicken which was made to order and took about 25 minutes to prepare. This chicken was amazing! It wasn't the best I ever had, but definitely really good stuff. The white chicken dinner came out with 2 big breast and a wing that was piping hot, crispy, and super juicy.

The crisp on it was near perfect. But when tasting it, I felt disappointed. Maybe I just like a little more seasoning or taste. It didn't have as much flavor as I thought it would.

It was just divine perfection.The rib plate comes with potato salad and baked beans, but I had just opted for the ribs by themselves, which came 5 big ribs to a plate, with pickles and onions.

The waitress informed me that they make their own Ranch dressing, so naturally I got ranch dressing. It was great - I especially liked the big slices of fresh tomato in the salad. I also tried barbecue pork ribs for an appetizer. What a great way to start a meal - people talk about the fried items at Barbecue Inn, but the ribs just fell off the bone. I will definitely be back to Barbecue Inn, and it will be hard for me to leave without enjoying some more of these ribs.I would be remiss if I didn't mention that Barbecue Inn is also BYOB - you can't beat that. All in all, an outstanding meal. I will include this restaurant in my rotation from now on - I just wish it didn't take me 26 years in this city before adding it.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,barbecue-inn-houston,barbecue-inn-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/barbecue-inn-houston?start=100,Gary C.,"Houston, TX",83,10,,,4/16/15,"Great food, chicken fried steak is the best I have ever had.

Very old decor and dimly lit, which didn't hurt. I ordered the southern fried chicken which was almost $13 which you get 3 pieces and you get a salad with your meal, still cheaper than the Chicken Ranch. The salad was lettuce and tomatoes ONLY, what satisfied me, was that the French dressing was actually Catalina and they make sure you get enough of it. I tend to ONLY like a little salad with my dressing anyways, #dontjudgeme. Being that they let you know the chicken will take 25-30 minutes I ordered a stuffed crab, it's a little gritty but not bad I didn't finish half of it. I would never order it again, it was comped. Now the main course, the chicken... It is beautiful looking, near perfect crust that doesn't crumble when you touch it. I got the French fries, which were pretty good once I added some salt. It sucks that I would rather rate the fries than the chicken though. The crust is near perfect, however, this bland chicken and should only be served in a hospital/""old folks home."" It's very moist so I know it's probably marinated in buttermilk or something. What good is it to have a Bentley that's only kept inn the garage and not driven??? I'm not sure who has rated this chicken 5 stars, let alone 3 stars but, you're crazy. I'm giving it 3 stars due to the fries and Catalina dressing.

It's one of those old school, 70's era eateries, complete with diner counter, diner waitresses in full uniforms, and booth seating as far as the eye can sea. The BBQ Inn likely hasn't changed since it opened - and the patrons appear the same. This place is legit and doesn't even know the meaning of pretentiousness. We all got the fried chicken, based on the numerous and glowing reviews here on Yelp, and that fact that everything else on the menu held little promise. You know how you can get crabcakes at your local all-nite diner, but they are sure to be bland and awful? And how your best bet is to stick with the pancakes? Kind of like that. Two folks got the fried chicken breast and I went with the mixed bone-in fried chicken. Theirs was better. The chicken was slightly overdone (but not inedible), and the fried coating basically tasted like burnt salt. Needless to say, no one was particularly impressed with the food.All in all not a terrible place for a neighborhood eatery. If you could walk here from your house it'll probably do fine. It's just that with all the really, really good options available in the Heights, it's hard to justify coming here again.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,barbecue-inn-houston,barbecue-inn-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/barbecue-inn-houston?start=100,Matt G.,"Spring, TX",1,25,1,,10/27/15,"I have lived in Houston now for 27 years and sad there are not more places like the Barbecue Inn.

It was fantastic, like it had always been with a light crust, tender and the perfect gravy. It came with fresh cut french fries and a salad.I have tried everything at this restaurant throughout the years and I say either order the Fried Chicken, Chicken Fried Steak or the Shrimp, and you will never be disappointed. I do not recommend the barbecue. They might had started just serving barbecue when they first opened way way back in the day, but it's their Fried Chicken, Chicken Fried Steak or Shrimp that has keep them in business since the 1940's. The waitresses are right out of any diners you see on a TV show. They are quick, efficient and never leave you wanting anything. I just know one day they will tell me to kiss my grits.This is just a small family run restaurant. I heard a rumor that Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Channel had asked them if they could do a show on their restaurant and they refused because they said they are crowded enough. Now, a restaurant that doesn't advertise or have a web page and just goes by word of mouth and is crowded EVERY night goes to show you that their food is fantastic enough. Give yourself one pleasure in life and give this restaurant a try just once.

Barbecue Inn is just such a find. I had heard many times over the past year that this was in fact THE place to get fried chicken in Texas. Not only that, but it was rated rather highly as being one of the top ten friend chicken restaurants in the whole country! I love fried chicken and I had to see why this was the place to be.It was packed yesterday when we went at lunchtime during inclement weather. Good sign. After finally parking, we were seated immediately in a comfortable booth. This place is definitely old school like everyone says. It's an old diner with counter, booth and table seating, small, and with that homey, neighborhood feel.Basket of crackers and butter was promptly brought to the table. Haven't seen this in ages. I like it. I munch on several kinds while we wait for our chicken. The menu says up front that if you order fried chicken it takes 20-35 minutes. I'm good with that. They make it to order so it's perfect and fresh.We chatted and our drinks were happily refilled and we continued to get attention and then our food came out. It was glorious! Steaming hot; smelled delicious. Big chunk of parsley garnish on the plate too. Heck, I would've been disappointed had there not been. The chicken was absolutely divine. It was just perfect. Hot, steamy, not greasy at all. Not salty. The coating was thin, crunchy; the chicken inside succulent, tasty; each bite just as satisfying as the previous one and then it was gone. Wow, I ate 3 pieces of fried chicken, same darn good cold slaw and baked beans too.I ordered a piece of buttermilk pie for dessert because why not? I wasn't even hungry at all but I'm a pie maker and this is an old school place. So, I had to try it. The crust was perfect (filling on the sweet side for me), but I would've expected nothing less.I guess this place started out as a BBQ joint and they still do that but all you could smell inside and out was that yummy chicken frying.

They raved about the food, saying that the fried shrimp and the Chicken Fried Steak were the best they had ever had. Told us about the charm of the feeling like you are stepping back in time, as this place remains largely unchanged since its early days, it's family run since day one, and has been open for 65 years. I checked out their web site and was looking forward to the whole experience.We arrive at 7pm, Saturday night. The place is packed. No parking spaces left in the primary parking lot. So, the security guard that is walking the lot advises us to park in the ancillary lot on the back side of the restaurant. We make our way to meet our friends at the front door and have a relatively short wait for our table for six to be ready. It is definitely like a step back in time. They obviously have a big early bird crowd, as many of the exiting diners appear as if they could have been dining there since the restaurant opened! The place is bustling with patrons, with the din of active conversation and a busy dinner service, I am looking forward to dinner even more now. So, we arrive at our table, order drinks and start to look at the menu. Eventually we decide to just go with our friends suggestions, as it's our first time and hey, they should know. Disappointing is really all that can be said. If it were not for the great company, the whole thing would have been a waste of time.The ""salad"" is just chopped iceberg and tomato. The home made ranch dressing was good, but nothing special. Who would have thought at the start of the night that this would be the highlight of the meal?!?! The baked beans were the only other part of the dinner that was good. They had great texture and a wonderful smokey flavor. The Chicken Fried Steak was barely okay. A lot of breading, the steak was of poor quality and the gravy was bland and floury, overall it was soggy and pretty tasteless. The french fries were horrible, oily, limp, under seasoned, undercooked and cold. Almost like they had been prepared earlier en mass and just used throughout the night. The fried shrimp were way overcooked and also bland and their version of coleslaw needed help. If you are going to add green pepper to coleslaw, it ought to be in a reasonable quantity and not completely take over the dish. But, at least with the green pepper in it, it had SOME flavor, even if undesired!The final food item is the Lemon Meringue Pie. It looked great, but tasted just okay.Sadly, this experience was also overpriced as well. The two meals (of moderate portion size), described above, two domestic beers and a glass of iced tea were $47. FYI, our server was very good. lol at least there's that!I am not sure how I will break it to our friends, but we wouldn't choose to go back.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,barbecue-inn-houston,barbecue-inn-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/barbecue-inn-houston?start=120,Margie Z.,"Houston, TX",12,36,13,,8/16/10,"All these years of driving by this place and I never went in until I read Robb Walsh's review in the Houston Press.

I love brisket, biscuits and gravy, and chicken fried steak. I have owned a truck and cowboy boots and use the word ""y'all"" easily. Given that I've lived in Texas all my life, I am stunned into silence for a second when I travel and someone asks me out of the blue: ""Are you from Texas?""Continuing the hunt for the best fried-chicken in town, fellow Yelpers Steve C and David G went with me on a recent Saturday to check it out. It was not our first time at this rodeo [heck, there's hardly anything left for us to try for a ""first"" time] - we've each been to the Inn separately but it was the goal to sample the fried chicken that drew us together today.The Barbecue Inn reminds me of classic yesteryear Texas: décor is retro ""Mad Men"" era stuff for a local Southern eatery but clean and well-kept. As Steve noted in his review, it would appear that they preserved the flavor by putting new reproductions in place of the original items. Very classy and a sensible way to avoid alienating the veteran customers.Warmly welcomed by the hostess, we settled into our booth. Our friendly waitress quickly set down the standard wicker basket of crackers and pats of butter while handing us menus and taking our drink orders. I'm not sure if it was the holiday weekend or just the usual Saturday lunch crowd, but we had no less than 3 chipper waitresses check on us, refill drinks, clear plates, and offer dessert.After placing my order of fried chicken ($12.35 for white meat only), we amused ourselves with stories, the crackers, and the included simple iceberg salad with diced tomatoes. This is not the place to find nouveau anything, much less a salad composition. Nope, you're getting lettuce with tomatoes. Dressing options are limited to oil-and-vinegar, ranch, honey mustard, French, and Thousand Island. Fat-free? Don't make me laugh.The prepared-to-order fried chicken came out after about 15 minutes and was a beautiful sight: three pieces [a leg, a wing, and a huge breast] of crisped golden skin wafting a tempting aroma. Unfortunately, I had to suffer and wait another 5 minutes to allow it to cool enough without burning the mouth. Oh, the humanity! But, the juicy succulent meat was the reward for the effort. Truly a simple yet exceptional piece of cooking. It comes with a couple of slices of white bread and a side of fries but those were almost wasting good plate real estate - focusing on eating every scrap of delicious chicken, I only ate about 30% of the fries and skipped the white bread.After the delivery of the chicken, a lady at a neighboring table interrupted our chat to ask me if the wait was really the listed 20 minutes and was it worth it. She told us that her boss wanted to come here for lunch but wasn't sure if it was worth the share of a limited lunch hour - from the looks of the chicken, it would be worthwhile but I'd be more worried of the productivity-sapping goodness of it. Post-meal, I tried to fight off the stupor but finally succumbed to a ""nap"", which lasted 3 hours.The Barbecue Inn needs to put a warning label on this great chicken: ""Do not attempt productive activity after eating this meal. Do not operate heavy machinery. Bring a designated driver to get you home safely."" 4.5 stars for a superb, if not dangerous, fried chicken meal.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,barbecue-inn-houston,barbecue-inn-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/barbecue-inn-houston?start=120,Stephanie C.,"Houston, TX",15,2,1,,1/21/12,"I came to BBQ Inn looking for amazing fried chicken and am sad to say I was highly disappointed. After waiting the 30 minutes the chicken arrived steaming hot.

David loves fried chicken, and Edgar's never steered us wrong, so off we went (without inviting Edgar - how mean of us) for a journey north of the loop.The reviews had prepared us for the retro look, which seems right out of the 60s. But it wasn't the tired run-down retro that I expected, the place seemed to have been remodeled recently, everything was very clean and comfortable, while preserving the 60s feel.The service was exemplary - efficient and genuinely friendly. Like the other ladies waiting on tables our server seemed like she'd been there for years yet greeted us warmly like we were her first customers. We were greeted with a basket of crackers and butter. Which seemed odd but I tried some butter on my melba toast and it actually worked. Our dinners came with salads of iceberg lettuce and tomatoes and homemade dressings - buttermilk ranch and thousand island. Although the salads were simple, the ingredients were fresh (not salad mix) and the dressings were both excellent. The salads and crackers helped pass the time as there was a bit of a wait for the chicken, though I don't think it was as long as the 20-25 minutes listed on the menu.David ordered the fried chicken and I got chicken fried chicken. David won the quantity war, with three pieces including a giant breast while I had just the one smaller breaded chicken breast. We both concluded that our chicken was among the best we've had, though not quite the best. I was really impressed that my chicken fried chicken had excellent flavor yet wasn't too heavy - both the crispy coating and the cream gravy were full of flavor but not greasy or overwhelming. It was served with a generous portion of fries that were good but could have been crispier. David said similar things about his fried chicken - great flavor, not too greasy, he felt the coating was a bit too thick and hard, but the chicken inside was wonderful.Having lived most of our 15 years together in Orange County, California, this place reminded us both of the chicken dinner restaurant at Knott's Berry Farm, which has been in business for over 75 years. Also very retro, great food, generous portions, nice people, but on a much larger scale. We are pleased to find Barbecue Inn and will certainly be back.

Plus, they give you a TON of fried chicken--three huge pieces. The con about the chicken was that it was not as flavorful as I wanted it to be. It just tasted like fry and chicken.

Also, all of the other patrons are going to be waaaaayyy older than you. Also doesn't matter - you will have your nose buried in your fried chicken.The pies are like your grandma makes - they are okay, not great. So, since you are feeling so painfully full from eating the third piece of chicken when you know darn good and well you should have stopped after the second one, you would not be missing out on fantastic dessert if you wanted to skip.

We waited at the entrance to be seated, and waited 5 minutes. Waitresses and the gentleman (maybe the manager? owner?) looked at us, still didn't acknowledge us. So we decided to just place a to-go order. So we went to the other window and then finally someone acknowledged us. We explained to the lady that this was our first time and we had heard the fried chicken was good. She explained what came with the meal, the sides, etc. We were told it would take 20-25 min and we could sit at counter to wait. We waited for a bit outside and then came inside and sat at counter. No one, no one, not a waitress, not the manager/owner guy, no one acknowledged us, heck even looked at us. No one asked if we needed anything (the lady who took our order had left and the lady who rang us up was at register so the others didn't know we had to-go order). No one even looked at us - even the waitress who stood in front of us packing pies in to-go containers didn't even say anything to us. Another 15 min for our food - when it was ready, no one thanked us or said ""see you again"" (you know the usual restaurant sayings). Basically we felt like we were strangers in a place we didn't belong. We didn't get a friendly vibe from any of the employees. It was a bit awkward. Given that - probably won't go back. And we haven't even gotten to the food review.Food Review = Fried chicken - ehh, not the best. Could use more spices, but it was fresh. Potato salad - the best I've had!

I remarked to AZ that it appeared that we must have accidentally gone into the nursing home restaurant as we were by far the youngest patrons of the restaurant (with most patrons in their 40s to 80s). The menu is chock full of cholesterol inducing favorites: BBQ, fried chicken, chicken fried steak, chicken fried chicken, fried shrimp, and stuffed crab. We started with BBQ ribs. The ribs were nicely smoked and I enjoyed the nice peppery rub. The ribs were not particularly meaty, but what did appear on the bone had nice flavor. The ribs were not as tender as I would have hoped. The thin sauce was bland and boring. I didn't think it added anything to what otherwise was a decent rib. I went with the fried shrimp and stuffed flounder. The fried shrimp was prepared like your traditional Red Lobster. There appeared to be no spices added to the fry mix, and the covering was neither too thin or too thick. Yet, the Barbecue Inn used jumbo sized portions of shrimp, and I was satisfied by their classic preparation of a classic dish.Like the fried shrimp, the stuffed crab contained enormous chunks of crab. I wasn't too thrilled with the rest of the mixture though. I probably would try the chicken fried steak or chicken if I came back. Both of those dishes looked excellent. The baked potato already contained butter, but you were allowed to stuff with cheddar cheese, chives, and sour cream to one's heart's content. Surprisingly, there was no bacon.The service here is remarkably sweet and friendly. It reminds me of why I miss the South so dearly. If you are willing to drive a bit outside of the Inner Loop for some comfort food, the Barbecue Inn should be on your radar screen.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,barbecue-inn-houston,barbecue-inn-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/barbecue-inn-houston?start=180,Robert N.,"Philadelphia, PA",60,3,,,2/23/12,"Best Fried Chicken I have ever had!

That is because they were recognized, in the article, as having Houston's best Fried Chicken. Well, I do not agree with the article...... at all! I ordered their all white fried chicken plate. It came with a salad, fries, and a couple of slices of white bread. My two dinner dates shared a fried shrimp plate, which also came with a salad, fries, and a couple of slices of white bread. Anyway, any fried chicken connoisseur will tell you that the batter or breading is the key to a great piece of fried chicken. That is because the meat will almost always be juicy, unless the food preparer totally screws up the cooking or leaves it sitting out for a long time, which will not be the case in any reputable establishment. So, having someone say that the fried chicken is juicy means nothing more than the establishment is not being run by a bunch of you know whats and offers no value to the food review reader. I tell you all this because my biggest disappointment with BBQ Inn's fried chicken is the way they prepare its edible shell. There are two key aspects for a batter or breading to be enjoyed, the flavor and to a lesser extent, the texture. Now the BBQ Inn does a great job with the texture. The fried chicken blanket is light and crunchy and holds up its crunch even when it is laying on a plate waiting to be eaten. Some batters or breadings begin adsorbing the water and oils of the chicken and turn soggy, but not BBQ Inns. It is a marathoner for crunchy longevity. However, in the taste department, it does not show up. I mean there is absolutely no taste to their fried chicken force field. But, I guess that is not 100% bad, because it could have tasted like shit, but it didn't. Still, I was definitely anticipating it would have some flavor even if it was just plain salty, but there was no flavor to be found. One of the reasons why I can't get over the missing flavor is because you could see that they had added spices to it. There were specs of different colors all around the chicken and they were evenly distributed, but still, there was absolutely no flavor. It felt like a rude trick was being played by the chef, preying on the weak of stomach and palate addicts. Someone who hates people, like me, that eat for the joy of taste bud stimulation.So, if eating chicken that has absolutely no flavor is up your ass. Ah... I mean alley. Then give BBQ Inn a try. They will surely not disappoint. Even still, I think the thing that really left the bland taste in my mouth is...

Also included is a large portion of fries. These were average. It does get crowded, so I would recommend coming before 7. Otherwise, be prepared to wait.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,barbecue-inn-houston,barbecue-inn-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/barbecue-inn-houston?start=200,Jean B.,"Beaumont, TX",86,37,1,,12/29/12,"We drove from Beaumont just to try the food.

Not only that, but the grease seemed a little old and my wife was nauseous the rest of the day. I don't want to pan the place, but I got the idea that it's a local place that got some national play, and from now on everyone is going to prop it up into something it no longer is just so we can have one of our own mentioned as great. The white gravy was tasteless, and sometimes grainy. Fries were OK but nothing special. Everything needed seasoning. The chicken was well coated and yes, it stayed on the chicken rather than pulling free at the first bite, but is that the standard for great chicken? I did like the brisket for its tenderness but again, not much flavor. The restaurant was filled with senior citizens and maybe that's the market for this restaurant, I don't see any reason to go back.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,barbecue-inn-houston,barbecue-inn-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/barbecue-inn-houston?start=200,Ripley G.,"Houston, TX",0,27,,,3/10/11,This place gets 2 stars for the friendly service.

The place is nice inside and has a sense of Houston nostalgia which is rather rare in a city that ushers in the new with no thought for the old, but I can honestly say I've had better fried chicken. Granted I've tried this place once, but I go to Houston so infrequently, my food experience will not have me going back.The Barbecue Inn has been opened since 1947 and has long been a favorite spot among the nearby Heights residents. The restaurant was named in an era when barbecue simply meant having a grill, and is in no way related to the way the term barbecue is used so popularly today. The place is very popular, so expect at least a 10-15 minute wait on weekends before getting seated. The crowd is mostly families and older folk, and based on what I see on the menu, I can see why. The menu is very simple, if not limited. One would think with more than 60 years of service they would have developed a little more out of their menu, but no. The menu is similar to what you find in a small town somewhere in Kansas. Barbecued pork spare ribs, beef, or chicken (prepared in oven or ribs boiled, heavy on the sauce and liquid smoke), fried chicken (both bone-in and chicken fried chicken), chicken fried steak, steak, fried fish, and shrimp, hamburgers. Side choices are very limited and include french fries, coleslaw, potato salad, and baked beans. Can I get a green vegetable here, something not starched based or drenched in dressing? No! Salads are tomato and iceberg lettuce only. I was actually surprised they had blue cheese dressing. Before your meal, you have a basket of crackers to munch on, no fun for the gluten-free set. So simple the menu, I have it recognized. With your tea, lemons only, the whole place is devoid of lime, that's pretty old school. Perhaps limes are too exotic? Some positive points is that it is one of the few sit down restaurants that serve bone-in fried chicken. This is a rare treat, most restaurants have scrapped serving bone-in fried chicken in favor of chicken fried chicken years ago because of the amount of time it takes. Only a few eateries come to mind that serve bone-in fired chicken, that's Earl Abel's in San Antonio, Stroud's in Kansas City, and Hodaks in St. Louis. Barbecue Inn some how makes the Best lists when it comes to their fried chicken, it mystifies me, but they get accolades and mentions from Texas Monthly, The Houston Press Best of Houston, Houston Chronicle, and Yahoo named it as one of America's Top 10 Places in America to get fried chicken. How? Why? My experience was far from any deserving list. The wait for bone-in fried chicken is a typical 20-25 minute wait (add that to the 15 minute wait to be seated). I don't eat crackers with butter on them, so I wait patiently for my tomato and lettuce salad. I am really looking forward to my 3 pc. chicken. When it comes, I'm in anticipation, it's plopped in front of me, I look at it and, well, the fried batter looks a bit darker than a golden brown, the first bite confirms my assessment, a bit over done in the fryer. Forget about a jalapeno, pickle, onion or Tabasco Sauce to spice it up a bit to compensate, here you get ketchup, or very bland white cream gravy (not even specks of pepper). For what is offered and what one gets, the pricing should be a little less, there's no reason a 3pc. fried chicken with iceberg lettuce and tomato salad, and fries should cost $11.35 or what ever. That's an $8 meal at most. This place gets stars for being a cultural Houstonian relic, a feeling of nostalgia, and actually serving bone-in fried chicken (not even Threadgil's in Austin does that anymore). It loses stars for lack of menu choices (no green veggies- green beans, spinach, broccoli, even corn or macaroni etc.) and failing to meet my expectations on the quality of their food, and most importantly, not being a barbecue restaurant. If you have friends and family that live in the Heights, you will probably go here at least once, just be prepared for the Great American bland.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,barbecue-inn-houston,barbecue-inn-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/barbecue-inn-houston?start=200,Robert S.,"Spring, TX",74,21,47,,1/14/10,"Yumm Yumm!

I had the cheeseburger was yummy juicy and full of flavor and lots of onions and mustard the fries wear great and home cut.

We are big fans of CFS and made the trek into a not so nice area of the Heights. What we got was a CFS that reminded us of hospital food...bland and flavorless (even the sides). Their primary clientelle appeared like they were an older crowd...Like CFS minus the salt to help their senior citizens monitor sodium? I have no idea. In an effort to salvage the evening...we ordered a fried chicken plate to split since we had also read that was good. We were fooled yet again. The texture of the skin was great. Nice and crisp and well breaded, but this time it was over salty.

Not as good as Frenchy's, which I had for the lunch preceding this dinner. The skin was crispy and flavorful, but the chicken itself, though tender, was a bit bland. As long as each bite had some skin, then it was great. The fries were bland and definitely not as good as Frenchy's. I really enjoyed my meal though. Portions were definitely generous. The waitress took such good care of me to the point where I felt like I was a guest at someone's home. My waitress said she had working at Barbecue Inn for 33 years. So the food was not mind-blowing.
