I know who to THANKfordChoosing this burger is like money in the BANKfordLoved by Tom Cruise, Tom Berenger and HANKSfordWill get you there faster than the way your Daddy SPANKSfordWait what?What to get: Old Fashioned Burger. The regular one. With Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, Mustard, Mayo.What not to get: Grossed out by the potholes on the surrounding streets of this Gross-ery.People really don't get burgers. The fact that so many people still eat (and enjoy) fast food burgers from places like Wendy's (worst of the worst), BK, McDonald's (both bad), Five Guys (literally no better), and worst of all, the criminally overrated Shake Shack, is a testament to my outlandish-yet-accurate statement. A few people still get burgers: the chef at Lankford's is among them.A burger is supposed to have a huge hunk of oddly-shaped, thick, large, juicy meat that shoots grease out of it when you bite into it (much like your boyfriend, and yes I would know). The condiments are supposed to just add to that ""juice appeal"" and get to the point where every bite is potentially lethal to your clothes, because so much goo is spraying all over your face and running down your chin (get your damn mind out of the damn gutter).Even the $20 ""gourmet burger"" places with their (tiny) locally sourced dry patties are just missing the point. DC thinks it's a burger town - so I hear. I tried them all. No Lankford's in sight. Nothing comparable.The best: Stamps in Jackson MS, Hamburger King in Montgomery AL, Ann's in Atlanta, Vizzi's in Buffalo. Paul's in NYC. To name a few. Now Houston has an entry on that list.And that is Lankford's.My sweet Esme brought me here a decade ago. At the time, I also did not know what a good burger was. I loved it so much so that I never stopped coming... (back).After Mike's record-breaking UYE (40 people!?), some Yelpers gave it low ratings, partly because of a server. But also partly because, as I said... ppl don't get it.Stick to the basic burger. Pimento, meh. Hot Chili - too spicy to eat. And that's me talking. Mr. I-can-handle-any-spice-level. Old Fashioned Burger. That's it.Yes, definitely a very brazenly Republican place and I don't like that. But this is about food, so OK. Pay at the counter after you're done. Tip the waitresses in a jar at the counter. I am sure the waitresses get less tips because of this. Sigh. The one waitress - I won't say which one - has a supreme attitude problem. Massive. You'll know it's her if you get her.Goddess says: ""Lankford is amazing! Their burgers are so delicious! Just be aware that the firehouse burger will blow your head off it's so spicy! And I like spicy food, but that one was way too spicy for me. I'll stick to the old fashioned from now on lol.""So there you have it. The #1 Burger in Houston. One of the very best in the country. Also try Stanton (fancier), Killen's (esp. the chicken sandwich) & Tookie's (fast food style w/chili).Thank goodness Lankford exists, and thank goodness it has lasted all these years. So a few - and yes I mean just a few - people can understand what a real burger is supposed to taste like, while the wayward masses flock to the tasteless Sh*t Shack and its ilk.Somebody yelled Shake Shack, my expression was BLANKfordWorst burgers on earth, tbh, to be FRANKfordMaybe I'll switch this burger for Shake Shack as a PRANKfordBut if I did that I think you'd make me walk the PLANKfordArrrrrrrrrrrr.... Anyway, I'm feeling like a SKANKfordMust be all this juicy meat and tasty buns at LANKfordWhen I stopped eating here, you know my belly SHRANKfordI ended up thinner than Hillary SWANKfordBut I suffered from withdrawal and my hungry heart SANKfordThe symptoms were worse than being in a septic TANKfordNot that I would know, er... anyway it STANKfordEspecially when eating burgers with a lower RANKfordLong story short, I came back to LANKfordThey only take cash, can I pay in Belgian FRANCsford?Even if they move to Germany, I'll be there saying DANKEfordHell these burgers are so sexy I could open a sperm BANKfordWHATTTTTTTTTTTT","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,lankford-grocery-houston,lankford-grocery-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/lankford-grocery-houston?start=0,Neville D.,"Houston, TX",0,17,1,,10/19/17,"Used to be BurgersLast three visits, dry over cooked and cold pattySoggy buns Very dissatisfied !!","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,lankford-grocery-houston,lankford-grocery-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/lankford-grocery-houston?start=0,Robert R.,"Sugar Land, TX",83,43,15,,10/18/17,"If you haven't been here and you live in Houston, you need to try it it.

They have a sign that says Lankford's been in existence since 1939, so they must be doing pretty well.I met a group of friends here for lunch. It was a busy Saturday morning, with constant flow of customer traffic. Most impressive was their waiter service, as they were on point. No delay in refills, and constant checking up, if we needed anything else.I went with an old fashioned hamburger with curly fries. They have a nice list of different types of hamburgers that are available. My hamburger was so juicy and bursting with that ground beef flavor. It was delicious. I devoured it in no time! The fries were seasoned and a pure compliment to the burger. I actually wanted to have a second hamburger, but held off at the last minute, as I was able to nibble off of my friend's triple patty burger. Overall a great experience and I definitely can see myself return. Lankford can easily be ranked in the top 3 burger joints in Houston with Stanton's and Killen's being the other 2.

It's my favorite on the Lankford's Grocery & Market menu frankly in all of Houston. I love spicy food that makes me perspire just above the lip and gives me flushed cheeks. This is how I wish Mexican restaurants everywhere would deliver my chile con carne or shrimp a la diabla. I have been here many times and some days the burger is spicier than others. On this last occasion it was the spiciest and it was at its best. If heat in your mouth is not your thing, try South of the Border Burger. They offer the traditional burgers too, there is something for everyone.I am a major chili cheese fan. Sadly Lankfords doesn't do it for me, keep in mind the burger is just enough. I barely had the energy to attempt the chili cheese fries. Skip the fries, I wasn't a fan of those either. They just didn't taste as good as they looked. Maybe I was full from the gigantic Texas size burger. The burger is more than enough, but if you have to have something try the tots. I strongly suggest, you have the burger only. The fries add on the calories with none of the taste. You will need some cardio later. (Most of this paragraph is actually just for my own future reference)Let's talk money. I don't have any, especially cash. I would come here more often, but we either have to plan the trip, or by the grace of God someone happens to have enough to pay for all of us. Big thumbs down. The price for a burger is reasonable. It's the extras that get you and I always want extras. Who doesn't? More avocado and cheese please! Oh, I must not forget the staff is super nice! The building is old but so darn cozy and cute. The wonky floors squeak and creak with every step, one of my favorite things about this place.

From what I remembered it had a greasy spoon feel to it back then. I had a burger and fries at the time because that's what it was known for and my only memory of the meal was average at best and that's why I never returned. Last week, I had an occasion to return and I am so glad I did. Currently, there is some serious street construction going on outside of the restaurant so it made navigating to the restaurant and parking a challenge. I was told that within just a few weeks the construction will move further down the street leaving the immediate area around Lankford's open. It was a pretty Saturday for lunch when I arrived at about noon. The first thing I noticed was that the interior seemed larger than what I remembered however I could be wrong. They also have several outdoor picnic tables out front that are uncovered along with a covered outdoor section also. I liked the interior decor of this 'old school' neighborhood restaurant. Like Stanton's, places like this are a dying breed. I decided on sitting inside and found an empty table immediately. The waitress immediately showed up and took my order of the old fashioned hamburger with their regular fries and a drink. I was surprised that the meal came out in about 2 minutes! For real! I asked the waitress about that and she said their kitchen doesn't waste any time! Both burger and fries were hot and fresh so I could tell I wasn't given old food. The burger was very good. Nice and big and flavorful. A good sized patty with lettuce, tomato, pickle and I asked for the onions to be grilled and they were. The burger was easily a 4. The fries were hot and crispy but were a 2.5. I suspect they were out of a bag and frozen but not sure. Not bad but next time, I will get either the onion rings, sweet potato fries or the curly fries to try something different. During my meal, the table service by the waitress was a 4.5. I wish I had asked for her name because she was very good and friendly.

We had discovered this place so we figured let's try it out.It's super ducked off in Midtown. like suuuper ducked off. I almost missed it because I wasn't too sure if it was a restaurant or not. It's close to Max's Wine Dive though. It looks like someone's former house. It's cute though.We walked in and immediately was serviced. You just pick your seat. Lady asked us for drinks before we even sat down so you know they'll try to get you in and out (probably due to them closing at 3pm).It's called Grocery & Market but I didn't see any groceries. I'm confused about that. Maybe they use market fresh ingredients. I'm not too sure.so the burgers came out and these hoes are huge. i ordered the grim burger (which comes with mac & cheese, jalapeño, bacon & sunny side up fried egg) and my friend ordered a cuban burger (which comes with shoestring french fries, cuban sauce, swiss cheese, red onions and ham).the grim burger was...extra ok. I was expecting more of cheesy flavor from the mac & cheese but its lowkey watery noodles underneath an already established burger. the jalapeño masks the cheese too much and you're really just eating a spicy bacon cheeseburger featuring macaroni noodles.the cuban burger, however, explodes with flavor in your mouth on the 1st bite. the cuban sauce is a very sweet and tangy sauce that blends well with the rest of the sandwich. the red onion spiciness kinda sneaks up on you though. overall, it's a cool little burger spot. I wouldn't visit here all the time but I wouldn't mind eating here again. It's not horrible at all but it's not unique either. I'd give it a 3.5 if I could.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,lankford-grocery-houston,lankford-grocery-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/lankford-grocery-houston?start=20,Anthony A.,"Manvel, TX",56,287,961,Elite ’17,10/11/16,"Lankford Grocery is one of my top 5 favorite hole in the wall burger joints in Houston. The little rustic looking restaurant doesn't look like much, but the food is amazing and definitely filling. It's easy to see why the place is always packed during lunch time. A few things to keep in mind for first time visitors. When you come in, it's a seat yourself kind of place, so look around and take any available table that you can find. Sitting outside is great when the weather is nice. Next when, you're done with your meal, take note of the number on your table so that when you go up to the counter to pay, you can tell them what table number you were sitting at. Lastly, and most importantly, Lankford's is a CASH ONLY establishment, so make sure you have some cash on hand. I've noticed a few times when people have had to leave to run to an ATM machine to close out their bill. Price ranges for the food range anywhere from $7 - $12, so make sure you have enough cash on hand.Food wise, I order the burgers 90% of the time I come here. They do have non-burger lunch specials which are also delicious, but for your first time, I do recommend trying the burgers first. The burgers are huge, juicy, and delicious. They don't season the meat as much as I would prefer, but the burgers are still cooked perfectly and there are several specialty burger options to choose from. More than once i've had the Grim Burger which is a 1/2lb bacon cheeseburger topped with jalapenos and mac & cheese. It becomes a knife and fork affair and you'll most likely need a nap after, but it's totally worth it (if your heart can take it). You also have to pair the burgers with their delicious sides which include fries, curly fries, tater tots, onion rings, or fried jalapenos. They even have shakes and desserts if you even have room for those after your burger and fries.The place is pretty small inside, and again the it fills up during peak times so try to get there early (11:00-11:15) or take a late lunch. Keep in mind, however that they close around 3pm, so they aren't open for dinner.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,lankford-grocery-houston,lankford-grocery-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/lankford-grocery-houston?start=20,Arko B.,"Houston, TX",84,303,,Elite ’17,5/4/17,"Definitely the best burger I have had anywhere in Houston.

I have been hear a few times and my last visit was a few years ago. But this place is really good. The burgers I have had here has that nice homemade feel and taste to it. It's like a warm hug from a relative. Another note that I should probably tell you is that you might need a shower after eating these mammoth sized burgers. I had to unhinge my jaw for the first few bites. Depending on what you get, the toppings in the burger might gush out if you are not careful. For instance, I got the Firehouse burger because I like the pain of my mouth being on fire. I heard it was their hottest burger. While I was eating it I lost some of the jalapenos that were inside. They scraped past my cheek and into the basket beneath me. It wasn't my classiest moment but I was in heave so i didnt care. I ordered it with the Habenero sauce on the side. It's a sauce that has some bite to it but since it has a mustard base it didn't really bother me was the read sauce that you find in the middle of the burger. Holy hell that stuff has a super kick to it. It made me warm but not hot enough to cry. This is coming from someone that loves spicy challenges. So if you are sensitive you might want to get that red sauce on the side more than the yellow one. My friend got the burger I got last time, the Grim burger. My guess is that it was named because it is more than likely going to be the addiction that kills you. It has the unholy trinity in it: Bacon, Mac and Cheese, and a fried egg. Its so effing good but should be ate once a year like on your birthday or something (ironically). I still think that that burger is my favorite so far and the more I eat their burgers the more I will comment on them.The way that this place works is that you seat yourself. A waiter will take care of you. Then you pay at the counter. At the counter there is a tip jar where you leave your tip of 15%- 20%+..... not 10% not 0%. Learn some manners and tip appropriately.The only criticism I have for this place which is worthy of a one star deduction is that they are a cash only place. This is inconvenient for most people and it needs to be changed. There have been many times I didn't go here because I didn't have cash on me and it would be easier going somewhere else.

The food definitely takes awhile which they let you know upfront on the menu. In addition, if they run out of something they're out of it. We really wanted sweet potato fries but they had run out so we were out of luck.With that being said, this place is pretty good for a greasy burger place. Its located in the middle of a residential area and a little hard to find if you haven't been in the area before (which we hadn't). Parking is also a little difficult as it is only street parking so if the place is busy you may have to walk a bit.Lankford is located in a converted house with about a dozen tables inside and then picnic benches outside. It's first come first served so if there aren't any available you may have awhile to wait.The food - the firehouse burger is amazing! However with that being said, you need to like spicy/ All of our mouths were on fire after trying it. We also had the grim burger just to try it - wasn't my favorite. I wasn't a huge fan of the mac n cheese and egg combination. We also ordered fries and onion rings which were pretty decent. I am a fan of beer battered rings over the breaded which is why these weren't my favorite.The service was decent - it was a little hard to get our waitress's attention a couple times (especially when we needed more water for our burning mouths from the firehouse). It was pretty busy as we were there on a Saturday at lunch so that may have led to her not seeing us. I would definitely come back and try some other burgers the next time I'm in Houston.

I am very open to experiences.. all experiences..once.First I will share with you my part in this and why I'm giving ""good ole"" Lankford Grocery and Market 1 star: I should have ordered a burger. Period. I shouldn't have asked for sweet potato fries and I should have had my avocado in my purse like always. Atmosphere: Let's put it this way. When you look up you can see the garage doors rolled up, meaning you are sitting in an old garage. An old garage the size and old garage.. I think you get it. We were cramped like sardines at the table and I kept hitting elbows with the man behind me, who at this point is so sorry & emphatically trying to scoot more into his table that he's damn near under it. Believe it or not, that got me excited. Anytime you see a packed dining room or ""garage"" you assume that you are about to have the culinary experience of a lifetime. Not so much. Food:So beef is just simply to difficult for me to digest at times. There I said it. So I have to go with chicken or fish when available. Not only was it available but it's on the menu. I have to type the conversation I had with the waitress, so you understand..we will call her ""Mrs. D"" to protect her identity but there are only 2 servers..Mrs. D - What will you have ma'am?Me: I will do the chicken sliders..Mrs. D - NOPE! we don't have that today..Me: Alright. [eagerly waiting for an alternate suggestion because I CAN""T be the only person in here who asked for that today]Mrs. D - We can do the Fried Chicken strips sandwich, it's like the sliders but just one whole sandwich.Me: Cool, and can I get that with sweet potato fries?Mrs. D: NOPE! we don't have those.. they fryer is broken.At this point I am thinking ""well, are all these fried and onion rings I see baked? WTF..Me: That's fine. I will do regular fries. Can I get Avocado on my burger...this was my 3rd ""ask for something else"" strike. And I totally paid for it.My fries were under cooked and were not ""golden brown"" like the instructions on the bag say. My chicken sandwich was slopped with GUACAMOLE. a note about guac vs. avocado: An avocado is one thing, guac is another. If you are serving guacamole without the tomatoes but still mashing them with salt, pepper, lemon juice and garlic, it's no longer an ""avocado""..that's all I'm saying. One of the ""snaggle toothed"" waitresses wanted to say otherwise but I could really care less at this point. By the time the steam had stopped rolling out of my ears I wasn't hungry and to be honest my food wasn't good, mainly because it wasn't what I wanted in the 1st place. When my food initially arrived I put half my sandwich in a to-go container to save for later but I was so over it that I dumped my sandwich out of the container and gave it to a friend who had asked for one light years ago and was still waiting. In closing.. I will say that there was a line out the door and my friends (who I talked with via FB when they saw me check in there) raved about the place. Me, on the other hand had to be stopped from taking a sharpie to their menu and striking out all the things they didn't have today! If I have to be subjected to a tired chicken sandwich, some sloppy guac and under cooked fries, I would prefer that it be at my mom's house, at least then my dad will eat what I don't!","alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,lankford-grocery-houston,lankford-grocery-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/lankford-grocery-houston?start=80,Lauren G.,"Houston, TX",371,74,21,,10/13/15,"This place is a quaint little spot near montrose.

The lions share of Lankford's infamy is a result of the big-ass colossal burgers. Good beef cooked properly, in plus sizes that are virtually too big to finish, and with a diversity and creativity of ""fixins"" that will wow you to your cholesterol sodden core.My favorites are the Grimm and the Firehouse burgers, especially the Firehouse which comes loaded with every jalapeño and spicy condiment legally available in Texas. I literally go through a pitcher of ice tea to assuage my throat, but oh, it feels so good.Their daily lunch specials also come in morbidly obese portions, and are good rib sticking Texas fare, but it's the burgers that make this place a standout.I'd eat here more often, if the hours weren't so limited but, truth be told, it's probably better for my health that they close at 3pm. They were written up, as it were, in the TV show ""Diners, Drive-ins and Dives,"" which is completely merited, and now they stay busy.If you can fit it into your schedule this place is a must do. Sides, like fries and onion rings, are also big and fried perfection.

Ever. We also went at 1:00 thinking we would have passed the lunch crowd... We were right, and the crowd wasn't that bad.However, the service still was awful. The waitress wasn't rude - she was just too busy to wait on us.Waited for about 10 minutes for her to acknowledge us - finally she came over and we gave our full orders.Only one of the three burgers arrived as we ordered. Two of the burgers had stuff on them that were specifically requested to leave off. Sodas served in cans just annoy me. Lankford can afford a real soda machine - get over it and invest in one already. Burgers were extremely overcooked and dry. The amount of mayo on my burger was downright disgusting and I had to scrape half of it off to finish.Onion rings were good but way too greasy. I couldn't eat more than three.Also, whoever the guy is behind the counter needs to be a little more appreciative of his business. We came in, stood at the counter and I literally had to raise my voice to get his attention - he completely ignored us and even when I asked if we were to seat ourselves, he still ignored me. Scratching this place off my list - not worth the hassel and certainly not good enough to recommend. This cult following because of them being on Diners Drive Ins and Dives is only because it was probably good six or seven years ago.Don't waste your effort - There are zillions of better burgers in Houston.

I arrived around 1:00 pm hoping that the lunch crowd would have died down, but nope. This place was still hopping! No worries, I was able to find a table for myself right by the entrance.As I'm sure have been mentioned in many of the 200+ reviews on this place, Lankford is pretty much a place where you seat yourself. They have a few waitresses (three I think while I was there) who would come up to you and ask you if you'd been helped. In my case, it took them less than three minutes for someone to come up to me and help me out. Since it was my first time here, I opted for something vanilla just for taste comparison with the other places. So, I went ahead and ordered myself an old fashioned burger with bacon and cheese with a side of onion rings. Fast forward to the moment they brought out my order, my reaction was, ""HOLY HUMONGOUS, GARGANTUAN, ENORMOUS, COLLOSAL, BURGER!!!"" I mean, seriously, that thing was huge! As I undress my burger out of its wrapper, my mouth started to water and my insides felt funny because I knew I was going to have a feast! And as I sinked my teeth into the skin of that smooth, sexy skin of the bun all the way into the meat, oooo weeee! I was in love. I started to question myself, 'why oh why did I have to wait so long to try this place?"" Verdict: arguably one of the best burgers, EVER!!! The onion rings? They were good and they give you a lot! Unlike some places that would probably only give you five or six rings.I'm not going to write too long about this place because I'm sure everything good and bad have been said and mentioned by others. Service was good, food was great, and the prices weren't too shabby (except for the sodas. $1.75 for one can? Seriously?)Anyway, between this place, hubcap, and Stanton's city bites.

No problem there. I can get down with that if the food is good. We went early for burgers on a Saturday (around 10 am) and we walked, so no issues with the parking, wait, or getting a table like others describe. You just need to be strategic with your timing.So it comes down to the food. It was early and a lot of their burgers are spicy. Nothing in the menu was really speaking to me and since I'd heard these burgers are sooooo great, I figured I'd just grab a bacon cheeseburger. It was big, as advertised, but that's about all. There was certainly nothing juicy about it and the meat was totally flavorless. Just tasted like plain, unseasoned ground meat. I make better burger patties at home. I like mustard on my burgers but there was so much on this one it gave it that McDonald's feel to it. Not to say I'm comparing it to Mickey D's, just saying there was way too much mustard. It got everywhere. Also, my cheese wasn't all the way melted. What I'm saying is, there was absolutely nothing special about this burger whatsoever.

I came around 2 o clock and it wasn't packed. Which was a really good thing for me, seeing that others had said that there was usually a wait for this place. I was relieved. Also I was told that this place was in a garage. Nonetheless, it was in a garage lol.

I shared my portion with my cousin and I was really satisfied. The onion rings were probably one of the best I've ever had. They were crispy and the onions were sweet. As for the curly fries they were good, but I like mine a little more crispy. It was a balance of some crisp and some softness. Now, onto the burger, the burger was as I said above, huge.. The burger came with the patty, bacon, fried egg sunny side(my all time favorite egg style), jalapeños, and Mac n cheese. The patty was not as moist as I'd like it to be, but it was good. The buns on the patty were softee than I'd like it to be but was good. Bacon was good, but not crisp to my liking. The bacon was cooked just in between. I found there was too many jalapeños in my burger, I felt like it over dressed a lot of the flavor. I had to pick some jalapeños out. The Mac n cheese and fried egg were definitely a big plus. I always get fried eggs on my burger when available. They had another burger which was called the soldier burger but I wanted to go the extra mile and get it with jalapeños and Mac n cheese!

(My other #1 is still Hubcap Grill and my other #2 is Five guys' mushroom+grilled onions burger).But the meat patty wasn't as flavorful. Which is why their signature ""FireHouse Sauce"" is a must-have in order to enjoy your burger to its fullest. I sprung for the Grimm burger, which was supposed to consist of fried egg. jalapenos, and macNCheese. With these toppings, the burger might be a little too tall to bite into. I had a beef with the fried egg though... When an establishment serves a fried egg burger, the egg yolk must be slightly runny so that it can contrast the texture of the bun. Unfortunately, my egg had completely cooked through :( If you try the firehouse sauce, watch out! I liked this extremely pungent and fairly spicy mixture. (Imagine a mustardy, sweet relishy smell). It's hard not to get the sauce on your fingers. (JOTD: Pick your nose if you need to clear your sinuses!) It'll take a few hand-washes throughout the afternoon to get the smell off your fingers.Like most of the hole-in-the-wall joints that serve great food, this joint is cash-only.They have both indoor and outdoor (picnic-table-style) seating.

I've been meaning to try their famous burgers for a while, and finally made it on a Saturday at noon for a double date. We opened the door, and saw that the line was backed up right against it. Being a first-timer, I had no idea that this was both the line to order and to get seated, so I asked my boyfriend to wait in line while I staked out a table. The moment I settled into an empty booth, a server informed me that they had a system in place for parties who ordered first to take the first available booth. I apologized sheepishly and walked back to my boyfriend's side. We were eventually seated at the booth right next to their kitchen, and I got unknown liquids splashed on me a few times throughout the meal, as the servers came by to unload dirty dishes on a dish rack. I would definitely try to avoid sitting here if possible, unless you're just ravenous and can't wait for the next table. I ordered the Grim burger of course, because I love bacon, mac & cheese, and fried egg (not so much jalapeños) by themselves and it seemed like a genius idea to put them all on a juicy burger. The massive burger came out and I was expecting my first bite to be life changing. It was unfortunately, anticlimactic. The components needed more seasoning even on their own. When combined, it amounted to a pile of...blah. One of my friends went a different route and ordered the breakfast special frito pie. It looked to be enough to feed a family of 4, and she seemed to enjoy it. When it came time to pay, we were again confused because this was at the same line for people to order. My dining companions didn't know that it was a cash-only joint, and even after my bf and I scrounged together all our dollar bills, we were short. We explained the situation and apologized to the cashier, who did not look pleased. My bf and I awkwardly waited as our friends went to a nearby ATM for cash. By this time, we had given up our table of course, and there's really nowhere to stand and wait around except that crowded area by the door, unless you want to be in 100 degree weather outside. We had to tell each new person who walked in that they could go ahead, and that we weren't in line. If the food had been better, I've been willing to bury the embarrassment I felt and dine here again.

That being said, I likely won't return to see if this was just a fluke. Lankford Grocery is a staple of Houston dining. Featured on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives and also just by word of mouth, Lankford Grocery has a stellar reputation in Houston for fantastic burgers. I can't figure out for the life of me why that is.I get the same burger everywhere I go. Bacon cheeseburger with jalapenos. This helps me compare better and not get sucked into novelty burgers which there certainly is a place for. The menu at Lankford Grocery has several options that are interesting and enticing if you're looking for something different. The atmosphere is fine and the wait stuff was friendly and helpful. The value of the burger was excellent, especially at a dine-in location where prices tend to be 50% higher than burger stands. The cheeseburger came out, wrapped in tin foil, and as I ordered it (many places, out of habit, put mayo and mustard and I order dry so it's always a plus when they get your order right). It was huge but it was already falling apart. The bun wasn't just soggy, it was wet. Wet like water was splashed all over both sides. The toppings instantly began falling out and I was grasping for dear life. The bacon was undercooked and also soggy which took away from its flavor. When isolated it was a nice, thick, hearty cut of bacon but not cooked long enough. The cheese was bland but creamy and the jalapenos were fantastic. After fighting to hold it together for a few bites it was no longer worth it. The bun was too soggy to enjoy and my basket was just a mess of bland meat and veggies.We ordered regular fries, curly fries, and onion rings. The curly fries were the best but were drastically under seasoned although they were hot and crispy. The regular fries were also bland and so were the onion rings. The onion rings also were so thin you only tasted the batter which tasted like the chicken that was most likely cooked in it.With ""C"" being average:Burger - DFries - DAmbiance - BService - AValue - BOverall: C-I assure you that I am not a hater.

I got myself a South of the Border, and I sweated it out since I'm not good with spicy. This one turned out to have quite the kick, and I'm not sure why as I'm typically good with a similar order at other restaurants.I went with three of my guy friends, and they were loving it. Two got Grim burgers, and one got a Philadelphia. The ones who got the Grim burgers were really happy. The Philadelphia eater was satisfied. Afterward, they all commented that it represented the ultimate burger -- messy.

No, that wasn't one of my suave Harry Potter pick up lines I drop at the bar. This is engorgio of two distinct characteristics: [1] the spell that turns an ordinary burger into the massive and amazing Grim Burger and [2] my waist size after eating this burger, and how many more of them I will be eating on subsequent repeat visits seeing as I am now a big (hehe) fan of Lankford Grocery & Market as well as the Grim Burger.Finding this place is a bit tricky. I missed it the first time, even with the nav yelling at me, because I was trying to figure out what the ""F"" in F Bar stood for and that fixation brought me a few blocks before the nav yelled loud enough for me to realize I was hungry and needed to eat. So I turn around and finally get to Dennis Street and fly by the restaurant. I swivel my head and see if I can get a parking spot nearby - sweet! So I circle around and come claim my parking spot nearby - because walking is totally for suckers.They close at 3pm. I dropped in a little after 2pm and I had the pick of the litter for what table I wanted. It was not that busy but there were still some people around - including a hilariously mismatched lesbian couple (think like a ten and a one) sharing a cigarette - awwww I thought it was cute. I sat outside since it was nice weather and all today. It was a little windy, which made it fun sitting outside, like having to vigilantly watch your napkins and your menu from taking a stroll around the neighborhood.They have Diet Dr Pepper! That is a must -must -must have when I choose my lunch spots. They bring it in a can with a cup full of ice and there are plenty of straws in the repository on your table so you have everything you need. Your order gets taken quickly and it is about a 15 minute wait for your big juicy burger to be presented to your satisfaction.The burger comes wrapped in a sleeve of butcher paper to keep everything together and it sits on a larger piece of butcher paper in the basket (see attached photograph.) If you don't know, now you will know: the Grim Burger is a big piece of meat on a white bun (no wheat - I know, ridic') with a bunch of cheese, jalapenos, a boatload of bacon, Mac & Cheese, and a fried egg. It is deliciousness and sweetness and tastiness all wrapped up and smoked in a way that makes you feel pretty good about the world, since the world came up with the idea of the Grim Burger for you to enjoy on a windy but still pleasant warm afternoon in Houston, Texas. The Mac is the soft, noodly kind with a slightly tangy cheese - in other words, yum! The jalapenos are the BIG pieces of jalapeno, not those skimpy things Fuddruckers leaves out on the ""make it yourself"" aisle - in other words, you can actually taste a tiny bit of heat up in this piece! The cheese is piled on there. And the bacon? Paula Deen said it best - ""Put some more bacon on it!""I could not finish the burger, the cheese, the bun, or all of the bacon. It was just too much. But in the totally epic and awesome American way. I felt good about myself that I could leave some food behind - sorry starving kinds in Ethiopia, but you probably would not appreciate bacon soaked in the juices of jalapenos and Mac & Cheese.This place rightly deserved to be featured on Diners, Dives, and Drive-Ins on the Food Network. This is Houston-unique and a tremendous place to eat a big tasty burger. Jules and Vincent would instantly forget about that Hawaiian burger joint if they could have a taste of my Grim Burger.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,lankford-grocery-houston,lankford-grocery-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/lankford-grocery-houston?start=200,Michael P.,"Pearland, TX",77,176,76,,8/6/14,"Pros: big portions of everything so you'll leave stuffed, great value, very nice staff. Cons: burger isn't great (and that's all that really matters)I've had Lankford's bookmarked for probably two years and have been really wanting to try it out.

I think we sat at our table for about 20 minutes before a waitress even came to us. She even acknowledged that she was the outside waitress and this wasn't her real table. She came only because the front desk guy (the owner probably) told her to check on the party behind us (they actually came in 10 minutes after we did). Thankfully that table told the waitress that we were actually waiting first and that she should take our order as well as theirs!I was joking that it probably would have been faster to call the order in while sitting at the table and then telling them that I was actually already in the restaurant, but that didn't seem very classy since it is a family owned establishment.

The Philly had three kinds of grilled bell peppers, nicely grilled onions and a spicy mayo along with a slice of provolone -- sounded somewhat mundane but was an excellent burger also was enough food to keep me full all day and sent me into a full blown food coma (wound up napping afterwards and I never take naps). Extremely well priced at a mere $7. The lemonade is also made in house and was good, the better half thought it thin and sugary but that's what homemade lemonade is like and I for one really liked it.

I've been meaning to try this place out for some time and we finally found an opportunity to come. Apparently the combination of all the hype from friends and even being featured on Diners Drive-ins and Dives really elevated our expectations. Unfortunately, our anticipation gradually descended into disappointment.My bud ordered the Soldier Burger and I ordered the Grim Burger. Just two burgers... no sides nothing else, just two burgers. After 45 minutes, we noticed that people around us got their food before us despite having arrived after us. We also realized that they didn't even ask us how we wanted our burgers cooked (although after reading the other reviews, it looks like doneness isn't something they really consider anyways). We finally flagged down our server, who looked like she was in the weeds and asked about our two burgers. She went in the back and said that our burgers would be coming out next. Needless to say, our burgers were not next - after waiting another 10-15 minutes, it became apparent that our burger order had never even been placed for some reason.Just as we were ready to walk out, the burgers finally arrived. At this point we were hoping that the burgers would more than make up for the wait. Honestly, I fail to see what is so great about this place. It is overrated in both food and service. The burgers were okay, but nothing spectacular. By the time we finished our burgers, we were pretty frustrated and tired and decided to cancel our orders for dessert (cobbler). We also noticed people around us were also experiencing long delays, including one table of three guys who had been sitting for awhile and finally flagged down a waitress who then told them that people need to flag a waitress down if they want service. Huh?We noticed that the servers don't get tipped directly - they just get community tips out of the tip jar by the cash only cashier. We felt that service quality suffers as a result in a place as busy as this. Seeing the tshirts and posters of Guy Fieri plastered all over the place, and comparing that with our experience and of the tables around us, we felt that this place was resting and cashing in on its publicity and laurels. It seems that it can't decide if it wants to continue keeping table service, while at the same time continues to herd people in and out like cattle. A recommendation: They should move entirely to counter service: people order their food, pay for it, and grab a number and a table. The setup right now is entirely too hectic and inhibits quality service of food.So fast forward a few hours later... I met up with my bud again later that night for some dinner... turns out the burgers we had for lunch didn't sit well with either of us. The burger was okay when I ate it, but it kind of just sat in my tummy all day... not really a good feeling.Once upon a time, when this place was a small local establishment, it may have been good. Today may have been a bad day service-wise, and it's unfortunate that I have to judge it on this one experience. This was a really frustrating review to write because I really wanted to like Lankford. In the end though, I now have no-so-fond memories of the food and service and I don't think I will be coming back anytime soon.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,lankford-grocery-houston,lankford-grocery-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/lankford-grocery-houston?start=240,George C.,"Huffman, TX",11,10,2,,5/20/15,Good food huge portions although the help is a little slow now.

Little did we know that the rest of Houston decided to try this place for the first time as well as many visitors for the NBA All-star game.It was just a mass of confused people as some weren't sure where to order, if they should seat themselves, or how to pay when they were done! We luckily got seats at the bar and so could watch the bewildered patrons as they lined up. And the line just got longer and longer as we waited.We got an order of fried pickles, a ""red, white, and blue"" burger and a southwestern burger. On their site they say that it will be a quite the wait for your food since they do it fresh and not fast - and they aren't lying. It probably took us about 45 minutes to get our food, but I will say it was all very good.My only suggestions? 1. They need to post a sign at the door for busier hours so people won't stand in line just to be told they need to seat themselves. 2. I'm not sure if our burgers were well-done because this is how they make them or because it was so busy the cook didn't want to bother. If it's the norm, they may want to change that and try to cook them to-order. Will we be back? Sure, but as my hubby said, this isn't a place that he would come if he just wanted a good burger.

I know, unnecessarily unhealthy, and I don't' usually eat mac & cheese, but it just looked like ""the"" one to get. It was yet another humongous burger, perhaps a third to a half pounder. The patty itself had a good peppery kick to it. Not too sure about the Kraft kind of mac&cheese... It did not add much to the taste of the burger, but it definitely made it a lot messier to eat! The burger buns were a bit of a disappointment to me. They were not toasted, and they were kinda soggy. They had this taste that I'm not sure how to describe, kinda like they have been trapped in the bag for too long, even though I knew this was not the case.

The egg was over easy/over medium. The jalapeno's added that nice bit of kick, and the heat of the sandwich melted the shredded cheddar cheese. The Damage - I always pay my debts, and this set me back a cool 15 + a few bucks for tip. But the most interesting thing about this particular quest to the North, was the Arya jumping around the place. She was yammering about some Gendry on her FB page, taking pics with some of the Sansas, and suggesting that her and Mom Catelyn start singing Icona Pop's ""I don't care, I love it"".

Completely and utterly packed. Couldn't find a place to sit as we waited for our food, and I'm guessing that's because the Diners Drive In and Dives episode had just aired. My fiance got the firehouse and he was having major issues eating it. A few weeks later, we returned with my friends. One of my friends (who could handle heat the best) ate it without too many problems, commenting on how hot it was but still eating it. And then we stopped going. By the way, I would always grab the mushroom swiss burger, and it was always pretty good.Two weeks ago, we decided to go back. It was the day of the A&M-Rice game, and it was nice to be able to watch Rice actually doing well on one of the TVs. We sat down, and waited for the waitress/waiter to stop by. Five or ten minutes after we sat down, another family sits down at the table behind us. Ten minutes later (twenty minutes, for my fiance and me), a waitress stops by the family behind us. They were kind enough to point the waitress in our direction, but still. Twenty minutes for service? Five or ten minutes after we ordered, the food came out. My fiance got the firehouse burger, and ate it without any problem. Apparently it's not as hot as it used to be. My burger (mushroom + swiss, no longer on the menu so I had to pay extra for the mushrooms) was pretty disappointing. The mushrooms were so big and probably not cooked all the way so that when I tried to take a bite a huge mushroom slice came out! I don't know.. I'm so disappointed by Lankford's now.

Like most people have said, this place is old and would be consider a dive. However, it's not dirty or run down. It's just old and gives the place character. If you want something with bright colors or such, then stick with McDonald's. Tables do sit close to each other, so you can feel a bit cramped. You need to go to Lankford's for the food. We arrived around 11am because we heard this place gets crowded later in the day. We had our choice of tables since the breakfast crowd had already left. Our waitress was very friendly and took our drink orders. We decided to keep it simple and order their old fashion hamburgers ($6). I got mine with onion rings and my wife opted for the tator tots.Our burgers came out quickly and were wrapped in paper the old fashion way. These are two handed burgers. The toasted buns were fresh, but they didn't fall apart or get mushy as we ate our burgers. The meat was thick and juicy, but not so much juice to make it greasy. If you know quality ground beef, you would be able to tell the meat was a good quality beef. We didn't taste any gristle in the meat patty. There wasn't a lot of seasoning (as one poster stated). However, if you expect this place to put a lot of seasoning in their beef to cover up a bad piece of meat then you are at the wrong place. It's amazing how many burger joints do this and some people like that. All we tasted was a good beef flavor meat patty with a little salt.The onion rings were the frozen breadcrumb breaded rings. The tator tots were also frozen. I don't have a problem with that as long as the main course of food is fresh.Service at Lankford's was top notch. All the waitresses worked as a team. We had three different girls filling our tea glasses. Our plates were removed timely and different waitresses had ask if we needed anything. Something we noticed was the fact all the waitresses were polite, friendly, and smiling. You don't see that too often even at fancy restaurants. You could tell these girls enjoyed working at Lankfords.The worse thing about Lankfords is we have to come from Sugar Land. However, hitting the HOV we can get there in about 30 minutes, so that's ok. If I crave a good burger cooked the good ol' fashion way, I'll go back to Lankfords.

We both stayed classic with a Homestyle Cheeseburger with cheddar cheese. Same fine result. Well seasoned, hefty half-pound beef patty cooked perfectly on the flat-top grill with sturdy bun and lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, red onion and mayo and mustard. Not fancy, just extremely tasty and as I expected it to be. The tomatoes are in season and having a couple of thick slices of what appeared to be locally-grown tomatoes made this burger perfect. My daughter agreed that it was one of the tastiest, juiciest burgers we have sampled. I have tried Hubcap burgers and a few other local favorites, and while they too are delicious, Lankford is still number 1 in my book. The hallmark of any great restaurant is consistent quality, and Lankford continues to knock it out of the park. Note: There's road construction on the side street next to the restaurant and that makes the typical challenge of finding a parking spot a bit more so, but park a couple of blocks away as you'll want those extra steps to work off the calories you've just greedily consumed.Original post from 09/16/15: I turned another long-time friend on to the burgers at Lankford Grocery today. Surprised he had never been there before considering how close it is to downtown Houston, but you kind of find out about Lankford by word-of-mouth and luckily someone told me about it years ago. Today we both had Red, White & Blue burgers and split a basket of French fries. Here's the blueprint: half-pound beef patty cooked to juicy deliciousness with ranch dressing, blue cheese crumbles, roasted red peppers and red onion. Don't get this one if you're on a date or have a big meeting afterwards, because there are lots of onions and blue cheese to tag your breath. I truly feel that Lankford serves up one of Houston's finest burgers and don't get there nearly often enough. This burger is $7.69 and worth every penny. The fries are of the previously-frozen batter dipped variety and are not fresh cut. I am not a French fry snob, so as long as they are hot and crunchy I am fine with them, but purists should take heed. You can't go wrong with any burger on the menu. As other reviewers have said in the past, this place is a local gem so get there while you can. The urban sprawl of high and mid-rise condos is encircling this bastion of burger heaven and one day the offer to sell the corner store will be too much for the owners to turn down. Don't be the one who missed out. If you know of a better burger for the price in greater Houston please let me know so I can check it out for myself. Until then, Lankford wins the prize for me.

The bacon might've been overkill though, my arteries clogged a little with every bite, and I think I only ended up finishing 1/3 of it. The rest of it went to my husband, who is well-known for his bottomless stomach. Overall, this is a good and classic burger, for those who like large portions without all the frills. And the prices of their burgers are phenomenal to boot. Husband ordered the Chicken Fried Steak, which I didn't like as much. The gravy tasted floury to me, and the slab of steak was thick and tough to chew. Curly fries, regular fries, and onion rings were tasty and well-seasoned, but nothing special.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,lankford-grocery-houston,lankford-grocery-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/lankford-grocery-houston?start=280,Martha M.,"Oak Forest/Garden Oaks, Houston, TX",0,12,1,,3/7/15,"Had a Mexican breakfast this morning.

The batter was airy and crispy just like a tempura. The burger on the other hand was not very interesting at all. Maybe they were in the weeds when my wife and I were there as they seriously must have forgot to put seasoning on the meat as it was completely tasteless. The heat level on this burger was intense.

A cute set up inside with tables scattered around the middle and some booths on the side. A counter bar as well. A huge poster of Guy, oh my.Service here depends entirely on what time you visit. I had an early lunch here most recently. I got in a little before 11 and the place was near empty. Which meant the service was prompt and friendly. Though at peak lunch hours, they are very under staffed. It is almost impossible to get service, and when you do it can be rude. The place is slammed at after 11:30 or so. Like that old Yogi saying, ""nobody goes there anymore it is to crowded."" OK, on to the important stuff. First like it says all over the walls and tables, no credit cards. Only cash. Burgers, other sandwiches, daily specials, and breakfast is what they got. Some of the burgers are just so over barring. I don't know how anyone eats them? The Firehouse is the one with the butthole hot sauce that is just nasty. There is also one topped with mac & cheese, a fried egg, and some other stuff. Again, so greasy and nasty I don't know how people eat it. The mac is not all that good either. The regular burger with cheese is decent, at least it is not a grease ball. Recently I had the buffalo burger. A buffalo patty with hot sauce, a ranch like dressing, and they said blue cheese. Though I could not find any. Anyway, while it was not the worst burger ever, it was again just a grease ball that makes you feel like crap. The bun is a sad, pathetic, and limp white bread bun you can get at any store. The fries are bland. I don't know if they are frozen or not, but they have zero flavor. All in all, a very generous 3 star. I guess it gets a little non chain bump from me.

Like I said it is served hot so when you break the seal the ice cream runs all down into the dish and creates a blackberry slurry type liquid.

The table was a 5 -6 seater but the floor severely canted toward the wall so I don't understand how more than two people could sit at this table, unless you like sitting and eating with one hip lower than the other.

The cilantro dressing, avocado and pepper jack cheese went well with the pico. Rarely does one run into such a wonderful marriage of flavors. Definitely my burger of choice at Lankford. The r-w-b burger looked delicious and very messy. H used 10 napkins while consuming his mess. The tots were meh. Should have ordered the onion rings like the table next to us or the basket of fried onion strips and jalapenos. Next time.It can be confusing for those who have never been to Lankfords. A line forms by the door for seating and paying. If you know you are next for a table and see one vacated, please scurry over to said table and sit down even if it still needs to be cleaned.

With mac and cheese, bacon, jalapenos, and a fried egg, this burger surely sits right with individuals who love heart-killing fare. Unfortunately, the mac and cheese was barely present--the penne was just too large to classify as a topping. The fried egg was overcooked... who likes a well-done egg in a burger? The bacon was crispy, at least. Back to the negatives: we asked for pimento cheese, but it was omitted. OK, to give another apple, we did like the extremely greasy cattle. The additional flavors soaked into the bun, to boot.Solid burger overall, but I just thought the execution was poor... people-wise and in the way of preparation.If this joint wasn't so dang overrated and we had a better experience with our service, Lankford Grocery would have sit right with us.

For a minute I thought the reason for not accepting credit cards was because maybe they didn't have electricity, but thankfully my assumption was wrong. Third, the restroom is a unisex ""in door outhouse"", so I strongly suggest taking care of business BEFORE coming here unless an interstate highway gas station type restroom is your thing. Nevertheless, I found the rustic and nostalgic setting somewhat charming and the staff friendly. I ordered the Philly Cheeseburger with onion rings. OMG, I thought they killed a small calf and served it on a bun. The burger was so big I needed a knife to cut it up to eat. This burger was the ""real deal"" hamburger meal baby. Loads of mayo, lettuce, tomato, onions and LOTS of beef! Cooked to perfection and served hot off the grill.

It seems the show so rarely makes a Houston stop that we should at least do our part to support a dive in our city. It took us forever to find the place and both of us knew that part of town pretty well. So map it out before you head that way if you aren't sure where it is.We arrived just as it started to sprinkle rain and were lucky to get a table on the covered deck outside. It took forever to get the waitress to come take our order because she was trying to save the paper towels and condiments off the picnic tables outside. So we won't take a point off for the slow service.My friend ordered the Firehouse burger and it was as hot as Guy promised it would be. Both of us asked for bacon on our burgers and neither had bacon when they arrived at our table. I was starving by the time my sandwich arrived and decided just to eat it. My friend went back in and asked them to put it on. they did.When I told the man taking my money that my bacon never arrived he said they may have run out. Well odd they could put it on my friend's sandwich after it had already arrived at the table.Anyway...we blame the lack of super friendly service we were lead to believe we would get on going the day after it appeared on Triple D. And we'll go back when it's not so busy and the staff is a little less grouchy.All in all the sandwich was great. Nice drippy grease and tater tots were a nice alternative to fries.

I'm almost positive that this was a solid, local joint that suddenly became famous thanks to Food Network and consequently had absolutely no idea how to handle the mad rush of incoming business. If you didn't already know, this place is a lunch-only, cash-only spot that specializes in burgers. There's plenty of seating but not too many waitresses, and an older gentleman who sits behind the register for you to pay after. In fact, seating is pretty much a mad rush; they'll personally seat you sometimes, but if you grab a table, and they don't notice, it seems they're fine with you circumventing the waiting process (if there even is one). And oh, you pretty much have to flag down your waitress (or a waitress) if you want anything done.We went during peak Friday lunch time, and it was an eclectic crowd of business folks, post-college guys drinking Lone Star, families, and a squad of cops. Interesting. We got a table, flagged down a waitress after 10 minutes to order, and promptly waited about 45 minutes for our burgers to come out. We distinctly noticed three tables that sat down after us (including the Five-O table) who got a waitress first, ordered first, and got their food first. Heck, one table got their food, ate, paid, and left before we received our food. So I'm one of those that isn't averse to bad service if the food is spectacular, but I regret to inform that the food is only ok.Their specialty (which I believe was featured on Food Network) is the Firehouse Burger, which features a habanero mustard mix. I opted for the burger with fried egg (can't remember what it's called), but asked for the Firehouse sauce on the side to try. It was surprisingly decent, but not spectacular--not hot enough nor flavorful enough. Everyone else when with the burger with guac and cilantro dressing, which I thought was a superior choice. The fries are solid, but not amazing. The onion rings were quite good but not worth the $3. One thing I will give them is that the burgers are absolutely gigantic, especially compared to the cost. Also, Lone Stars are just $2.25. So they've got that going for them, which is nice.Weird note of the day: our waitress actually threatened to shoot two of us for changing our orders right after she had wrote them down. We couldn't tell if she was joking. She then proceeded to pull out her gun--the old index finger and thumb routine--and give us a ""pow.""

Therefore, it should be argued that Lankford Grocery's strongest menu offering should be the burger. Even more so, if they have a wide variety of crazy burger designs, the plain cheeseburger should definitely provide a solid experience. A strong foundation is necessary to build upon with crazy toppings.I ordered a cheeseburger and fries. The burger and bun were both strong points, but the cheese was weak; it seemed more of the Kraft variety. The burger was hastily assembled, too, which I can mostly forgive given the recent influx of customers, but I found the sheer volume of vegetation (lettuce especially) off-putting - most of it didn't even stay on the burger long enough to make it to my mouth.They make their own queso, mac & cheese from scratch, and they grow their own habaneros, but they can't make their own fries? I can allow frozen tots, because I have no idea how you would make them from scratch, but why seriously degrade a burger experience with frozen fries? I was extremely disappointed.Their daily specials give me the impression that Lankford is not content with being ""just another burger joint"" but falling into some common pitfalls also tells me that they're not ""just another burger joint."" If I were to go back, I would probably opt for one of their more crazy burgers, like the one with the mac and cheese, bacon, egg, and jalapeno.

You have to hover and wait until someone leaves then grab a table before someone else more aggressive then you gets it. This did not work well as we had a party of 6 people. Ugh.

Went to Lankford's due to the cult like following this historic establishment owns. Was very dissappointed. This is a tourist stop at best.Burger had little chewey pieces of gristle in it that you can never chew up - ewwww. I really don't like little pieces of gristle and fat in a ground beef burger that ultimately must be removed from your mouth.Secondly, the smell inside is atrocious - the smell of pungent, old, stale grease - perhaps that comes with the territory of an ""historic"" burger joint, I don't know. I don't like the smell however, very unappetizing - so sit outside on the tables outside.French fries - nasty. Cooked in old and dirty grease. Tasted like someone has been cooking fish in the grease. Ever had a french fry with that sour fishy taste? That's what I experienced here at Lankfords.YMMV, but if I were you, I'd heed the warnings here and go get yourself a good burger at a chain like Five Guys or some other place that knows how to do burgers and fries correctly.","alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,lankford-grocery-houston,lankford-grocery-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/lankford-grocery-houston?start=400,David B.,"Spring, TX",510,320,166,,2/8/13,"I stopped in for lunch the other day to continue my search for the best burger in Houston. I have been working my way through some of the best places to eat a burger and found myself near here the other day right at lunch time. A win/win situation. I needed lunch and Lankford's was there. I had to park down the street and walk to the place as it was right during peak lunch. No biggie as it was nice outside and I definitely could use the exercise especially knowing I was going to be eating a burger and fries.I was lucky enough to find a seat at the counter with no wait so that was a big plus. I waited a couple of minutes for a waitress to come and take my order. The special of the day was chicken fried steak, which I had to thing long and hard over ordering. I had come for the burger though so I stuck with my plan and ordered the double meat, double cheeseburger, fries and iced tea. I was brought my iced tea in a plastic bright colored cup and sipped on it while waiting for my order. The place was packed so I knew it would take a little while before I would get my food. No biggie as I was checking out the place. Lot of history and it is reflected in the building. It looks like a house that is turned into a restaurant. After about 10-15 minutes my food arrived and I proceeded to chow down.I think I made a mistake going with the double. That is one big ass burger. I could barely hold it in my hand much less try to get it in my mouth. I had to take half bites from it eating from the top patty and bun and then the bottom. The patties are easily 1/2 lb each so the burger was well over a pound with condiments. It was a very good burger. The meat could have used a little more seasoning in my opinion. The patties were also cooked a little too long and not as juicy as they could be, but still were tasty. The condiments were trying to fall out of the burger as I was eating it and I had to keep hold of it in one hand the entire time or it would have fallen apart. Very messy and juicy with juice running out of burger and down the paper wrapper. The fries they serve are just regular plain, probably frozen ones. They are not worth getting again. I think I will try onion rings next time.It was a nice burger and the experience of eating here was great also. I could see myself coming here and trying the other burger offerings or one of their lunch specials. The place is cash only so be sure to bring some. The line to pay was stretched out the door. Luckily, by the time I finished eating it was only a couple people. I can see why this place has been around for so long. It is a great neighborhood spot where you can go and have a good meal and relax and be yourself. The total bill for double cheeseburger, fries and tea was about $12 which is not too bad considering how big the burger was. I will not be getting that one again as I could not finish it all.","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,lankford-grocery-houston,lankford-grocery-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/lankford-grocery-houston?start=400,Jason N.,"Houston, TX",72,25,,,11/10/13,"If you're reading this review in hopes of deciding whether to eat here or not, stop.

It's a very relaxing, mom-and-pop sort of establishment, which I always prefer supporting over the big chain restaurants-- we have way too many of those these days. I had the famed grim burger with fries and a diet Coke. It does, as promised, have jalapeños, mac n' cheese, and a fried egg; however I definitely could have done without the egg. It was cooked all the way through, which I think defeats the purpose of having an egg on top because you miss out on that rich, runny yolk texture and flavor. The mac n' cheese was good, although the flavor was subtle, and I thought the combination with the jalapeños worked well. The burger patty itself was flavorful and juicy, probably my favorite part of the burger. I split it with a friend and was completely stuffed with only half.The fries were good, but generally unremarkable. They served their purpose of providing starchiness to go with all the protein. I disliked that my diet Coke was a can and not a fountain drink (meaning no refills without paying for another) but that's a personal pet peeve. They did have a few burgers listed on the board inside that were not directly on the menu, such as the Western burger and the Greek burger, so those might be worth checking out. Despite all the reviews insisting on a long wait, I went with a group of about 12 people and we all got our food in about 15-20 minutes (this was on a Thursday around 12:30).

Each one of those items are filling and amazing on their own, but mash them all together on top of a burger and you would think it would be the best thing since sliced bread. First off, I did enjoy the burger...don't get me wrong. However, the macaroni and cheese got lost in the overpowering flavor of the bacon. The fried egg wanted to slide out of the burger, while piggy backing on the macaroni, which was exiting stage right with every bite. I still like the Firehouse Burger best at Lankfords, but I would recommend everyone try the Grim, as it is the strangest burger combination I have ever had.

Combined with slow service - leads to a rather ordinary experience.So a friend and I have begun a quest to find the best burgers in Houston, and he recommended Lankford after it was featured on the food network. We were told it was extremely busy and so decided to go for a late lunch on a beautiful Friday afternoon.The first thing I have to mention is carry cash. We didn't and found out it was cash-only once we got there. And thus we were forced to drive out in search of a bank so we could get enough cash for our meal.We sat outside, and the first disappointment was with our server. She seemed unsure of the specials, and as we found out later when we went to pay, that she has missed more than half of them. She also didn't push any of the desserts - something both my friend and I would have been interested in - had we not already gotten up. Also the service was slower than most other burger places I have visited - but maybe because it was a beautiful day to be outside - maybe because I wasn't really in a rush, or maybe because I had been warned about it - I didn't think it was too bad.We both ordered the ""South of the Border"" burger and decided to share an order of their ""Tex-Mex"". The Burgers had extremely well grilled patties with a good texture and taste - but the rest of it was somewhat disappointing. I suppose we were expecting with a little more zest with the promise of something with a Tex-Mex touch, but were rather met with an extremely bland burger that basically sounded like would burst with flavour and just failed to deliver.The ""Tex-Mex"" which is a combination of battered and fried Onions and Jalepeneos were ordinary and nothing spectacularly different.All in all, I believe this place has the art of grilling down but fails somehow to convert it into an exceptional burger. I'd probably give it another chance - but I'd be definitely looking for much more flavour from the burgers.","alt=""2.0 star rating""",2,lankford-grocery-houston,lankford-grocery-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/lankford-grocery-houston?start=400,Karl H.,"Houston, TX",1,43,,,4/3/15,"The pros of this place are the Grim burger was huge and fantastic and the onion rings were among the best I have ever tasted, probably second best ever.

Don't go here on your lunch break if you only have an hour as there is no way you will get back to work in time. It took 40 minutes - yes - 40 minutes - for our food to arrive and the poor waitress was harried and desperately overburdened.
