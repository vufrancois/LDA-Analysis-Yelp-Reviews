It has wood accents and is decorated with past photos of the restaurant. I've tried the personal size pizza, the lasagna, the New World Sub(hot), the Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo, the Heritage Chicken Salad, and the side salad. If it's your first time coming to Doyle's, I would recommend getting the lasagna. It comes in a casserole form, is piping hot, and is full of flavor. It kind of reminds me of Stouffer's Lasagna with thinner lasagne sheets. A coworker got the ravioli which looked similar as it comes in a casserole and is covered with piping hot cheese and tomato sauce too. The Heritage Chicken Salad with oil and vinegar was good as it had big slices of chicken. It's a filling light lunch. The Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo comes with small shrimp and is a little bland. The New World sub tastes just like it describes. The side salad comes with lettuce, cucumber slices, tomato wedges, and a Melba-size crouton. It's a little more bland than the Heritage Chicken Salad. The pizza tastes like school lunch/ frozen-style since it's not heavily spiced on the crust or in the sauce. The servers are always nice, and they're prompt in handing out the garlic bread baskets (sub bread with heavy spread of garlic butter). I looked around at the tables and think I'll try the spaghetti and meatballs next time I go.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,doyles-restaurant-houston,doyles-restaurant-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/doyles-restaurant-houston?start=0,Danish B.,"Houston, TX",92,123,48,Elite ’17,10/13/16,"I love Doyle's. They make their salad dressings from scratch (the Dill ranch is my personal favorite), and on some nights they give you a crudite' when you sit down to eat dinner. Their Buttermilk pie is the best thing, ever, but they do not always have it there, since it is home made, and people buy it while it is in stock. I usually order the Spaghetti Works. There is a BUNCH of cheese on top of spaghetti with meat sauce and mushrooms mixed in, then topped with 2 huge meat balls. Additionally, I love the Rueben and the Grinder. People talk about their pizza, but I never order it because I usually crack and order the Spaghetti. I'll work through the menu, one day. If you're looking for comfort food, at a fairly reasonable price, this is your place. Please note they are not open late (closes at 8 PM), and they are not open on the weekends, anymore.

But after reading a couple of trusted Yelpers' reviews, I decided to give it a shot. At first I thought about dining in, but once I got here and saw the take out order window, I decided to just order to go.Anyone who knows me knows that the first thing I do when I go to a new restaurant is to bust out my phone and start taking pictures. That's exactly what I did here. As I walked toward the take out window and point my phone at it to take a picture, the lady behind the counter smiled for the picture. I told her that this was my first time here and asked for a recommendation. She of course told me that everything was good. But I also mentioned that I wanted meat and another lady behind the counter recommended the Golden State Poor Boy sandwich.While I was waiting for the order to be ready, the ladies behind the counter invited me to come inside the restaurant to check out the blue ribbon awards the restaurant had received from the late Marvin Zindler. She also told me to check out the original menu from 1954 when the restaurant first opened and another menu from 1980 when the restaurant was 26 years old. Pretty neat!After a little bit of wait, my sandwich was ready to go. When I got back to the office, I opened the container and the sandwich was decent sized. Definitely filled me up. It didn't taste too bad either. But looking at at the menu and the pictures, I definitely want to try their lasagna, spaghetti, and pizza. Maybe the burgers too. I'm definitely coming back here in the future!","alt=""4.0 star rating""",4,doyles-restaurant-houston,doyles-restaurant-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/doyles-restaurant-houston?start=0,Jeremy T.,"Houston, TX",266,1381,1059,Elite ’17,12/19/16,"I dined here several years ago after hearing they were the oldest italian restaurant in the city.

Sometimes that can be bad but in this case it's good. You don't see many restaurants like this anymore. It's been here since the 1950's and it serves American Italian food. Yeah I know who wants to eat that? Well don't discount it until you have tried it. This restaurant has a big parking lot. There is a large outdoor pick up to go counter where many locals get their pizzas, sandwiches, pasta to go without having to go inside the restaurant. When you go inside you are transported back to the 1960's. It is a friendly place where you are greeted by a hostess and then seated. I have eaten here probably 5 or 6 times over the past 10 years. I will admit that when I think of eating Italian food I don't think of this place. For one its on 34th street and I rarely travel it. However when I do remember Doyle's I never had a bad thought about it. A few nights ago I was driving on 34th and drove past Doyle's going somewhere else. When I arrived at that restaurant I found out that they were out of food so I went back to Doyle's because it has been a few years since I last visited. Upon being seated I was brought a basked of buttery garlic bread and a small plate of veggies with ranch dressing. The veggies were baby carrots, cauliflower and celery and provided a different type of complimentary appetizer that was appreciated. I ordered the Spaghetti Works which is spaghetti, meat sauce, 2 meat balls, mushrooms and mozzarella cheese for $10.99.The food arrived about 10 minutes later and looked like a heart attack on a plate with all the melted cheese on top of everything else on the plate. It was yummy. A nice plate of food. As yelp,would say A-OK! Also my service was good.I give Doyle's a 3. It is one of those 3 score restaurants that I would not hesitate to return. This is a neighborhood restaurant that I believe they appreciate. Places like this and Barbecue Inn I hope will stick around for a long time.","alt=""3.0 star rating""",3,doyles-restaurant-houston,doyles-restaurant-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/doyles-restaurant-houston?start=0,Conor F.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,,6/10/17,"I've never been here or heard of it!

When I was greeted out side a very rude girl took care of me, I told her that I had a to go order and asked for my name.I paid and asked how much long it would take because knowing a chicken Parmesan would take a few more that 10 minutes let's me know it was not made fresh.The rude girl told me it's ready now and I was a little shocked that it was that fast. I paid; it was a little pricey for the area that we live/work in. $11 for a chicken Parmesan, I expected that at like a little more high end Italian restaurant.

I have always gotten the supreme pizza or one of their sandwiches, and decided this time to try something new and try the Meatza Pizza. I am assuming that is the pizza with all of the meats. For one thing, I thought it was very unusual that when they had hamburger meat on a pizza that they used REAL hamburger meat they cooked there. The sausage was REAL Italian sausage sliced up, and the bacon was REAL bacon that they had cooked and crumbled up and put on the pizza. Their toppings were not the kind you get frozen off one of those pizza ingredients delivery trucks you see driving around. I haven't had a real great tasting pizza in such a long time. I wasn't sure what I was eating it was so good. The quality of this little hole in the wall pizzeria was way above any pizzeria I have been to in Houston. The only problem was they put way too many toppings on top and it will take me 4 days to eat the whole pizza. Poor me, I will have to suffer through the agony. Haha!Like always, I just called in my order and picked it up on their side window. My wife got the Reuben and she said it was the best she has had here in Houston not including the ""New York style deli restaurants"". But there is no deli located near that location. My mother stops by there weekly because she says their salads are the best in Houston.Ok! I have to say I am a little biased about this restaurant. I have been going there since the 1960's when it was the only restaurant that had pizza. But, on this trip I didn't get the usual comfort food I am accustomed to, so it was different for me, so I assume I can leave a comment.","alt=""5.0 star rating""",5,doyles-restaurant-houston,doyles-restaurant-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/doyles-restaurant-houston?start=40,Kevin T.,"Houston, TX",4,17,1,,10/2/12,"Absolutely mediocre.

The future seems safe based on today's lunch crowd.The menu features mostly Italian entrees augmented by a diverse assortment of sandwiches, salads and other favorites. The eatery is known for its lasagna ($8.95) which is served straight from the oven in a nine-inch ceramic dish. The garlic bread is well done and is a handy implement to shovel the tasty cheese and sauce combination into your gullet. Don't worry about running out; more bread is just a wave away. Those of you choosing to ""be good"" should still cheat a little and get the Heartland Salad. Being good goes out the window thanks to the breaded chicken cutlet and bacon, but at least there's still more green than protein. Top it off with the bleu cheese dressing. But, be careful. The dressing is served on the side in a gravy boat; it is so creamily delicious that drinking it may seem like a great idea.Doyle's also features a walk-up order window (and call ahead service) for those of you who'd like to pick-up dinner on the way home from work.No matter how you get it, Doyle's is a can't miss safe bet for Italian comfort food and sandwiches.
