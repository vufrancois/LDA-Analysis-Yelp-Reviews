So glad you are back - I actually saw a woman crying as she took pictures of your place on our 11/15/2017 return to our favorite cafeteria in Houston. Anyone that visits your business can tell it is not the usual cafeteria - your food is cooked with love and skill. The meat - roast beef, turkey, and chicken, fresh vegetables, homemade breads, and delicious desserts are head and shoulders above everybody else in the Houston area.We enjoyed the tender and juicy turkey, dressing, gravy, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, green beans, corn, wheat rolls, and pecan pie on our reopening visit. took more than half of it home and enjoyed it over the next 3 days.

Neither the food nor the service was up to their usual excellent standards.This place has a long, long history of excellence and consistency.For now, I'm going to wait a month or so before going back.

It's worth mentioning that the clientele definitely skews 'older', so the seasoning is very conservative (one of my friends said a few of her entrees were a little bland). Not an issue I've noticed with anything I've had.Overall, this is a solid choice, and the only cafeteria I'd go to in the area.

Come when there is a line and the food is turning over quickly.TIP: Bring cash or check, because they don't take credit/debit cards.This place reminds me of what Luby's used to be when Luby's cooked everything from scratch. The quality of the food is better than any other cafeteria I have been to in the past few years. Everything just seemed so fresh. Lunch for 2 was $40 because everything looked so good, we kept asking for more and more.My lunch consisted of 2 large fried pork chops smothered in mushroom gravy, with large serving of mashed potatoes and brown gravy. The portions are large. I could have been satisfied with this, but I continued to ask for more. The small greek salad was assembled on the spot. Lettuce, tomato, pepper, onion and feta. It was good, not great, but for a cafeteria it was top notch. everything tasted fresh. The dressing could have been better.The broccoli looked so good, I had to have it. Again, the portion was large. It was steamed perfectly.My wife had a fruit salad. I tried a couple of bites and it was excellent. Reminded me of when I was a kid. The fruit looked fresh. Strawberries, kiwis, blueberries and apples all seemed very fresh. The peaches were the only thing that seemed like they came from a can. It was still delicious.She also got the fried pork chops and mashed potatoes. We both agreed that they were awesome. As with most cafeteria food it lacked seasoning, but salt,pepper, and many other seasonings are available at your table. Once we added a salt and pepper, the meat and potatoes were perfect.My wife also tried the sweet potatoes. She said they reminded her of the way her mother makes them. She tried to finish them off, but again, the portion was too big.We had to pass up all of the great looking desserts.

They were rude and were annoyed to serve me. They should not assume based on a person's looks that one cannot understand or speak Spanish. The first lady I met made a sarcastic comment to another lady working the line and when I broke out with ""Como?"", they quickly changed their tune (fake). The lady at the register yelled at several women while trying to get the correct change for someone's to go order and took forever to take my money. Once reaching the table, I spent 3 minutes waving and trying to get the lady's attention in order to get some condiments and a straw. I finally just gave up and got up and grabbed my own things. I even had to chase her down for a water refill and there were only 4 other tables with people at the time I went. She was so concentrated on filling salt and pepper shakers to notice the elderly couple who was also trying to wave her down. I finally told her, ""Ma'am they need your help"" and she begrudgingly went over to their table. I was so annoyed by the time I left.

It has been several years since we have eaten there and unfortunately we were overall disappointed. Unfortunately I can't think of any real positives, so here goes negatives:1 - Overpriced; we got 3 adult meals and 2 kids meals which ended up right at $50 (my wife and I didn't even get sodas as we are both giving them up). The receipt is very difficult to figure out, but from our best estimate, they charged for kids Jellos, kids rolls and kids drinks (in addition to the standard kids meal price). Our fault for thinking that these would be included in kids meals like at Lubys.2 - Good luck asking any questions (in english) as very few, if any of the staff that we encountered could speak or appear to understand english.... we were trying to ask questions like what this or that costs & we just got nods and ""yes"". I've never been to a restaurant that had no one around that could speak english, does make one wonder......3 - The food was lousy.... I remembered several years ago that the quality of food was a step above say a Lubys. Not the case anymore based on our meals. I had chicken fried steak that was as dry as beef jerky. The kids got fried chicken and neither liked them as they were greasy and cold. In summary, I'd say Cleburne's has headed south in both food and service.

No one on the line speaks English which is a problem. They can only nod or look blankly at you if you ask a question. 3.

The fish was bland and I had to slather it with tartar sauce. The potato salad was bland, no taste at all exept for lots and lots of onions, the macaroni & cheese was bland, not sure what was going on there and the black eyed peas tasted like they came out of a can. The cheesecake tasted like one of those box cheesecakes you buy off the shelf and go home and make in an hour. The crust was so crumbly and sugary that you couldn't eat it. Hubby had roast beef and it was bloody, but that's the way he likes it and according to him it was good.

Particularly I like the veggies, however have seen a decline in what was once great. The boiled spinach has no taste but is still preferred over the spinach casserole. However, last week and possibly my last visit here, their was no fresh spinach so as last resort chose the spinach casserole. Along with other veggies on my vegetable plate I tried the casserole and to my dismay it was horribly burned under that Parmesan topping and on top of that, the bottom was burned as well. I ate the other 2 veggies and whatever I could manage to pick out of the burned layers of spinach. The center was so dry that I just could not eat it. So before I left I was told by cart lady to take to cashier which I did explaining how bad the casserole was burned. She looked at it and recognized that I tried eating from center and told me I did not return the full portion and she pulled out $2 and gave to me. I had eaten maybe 20% of what was in center of burned layers. Neither the owner nor the manager was around so the cashier in an admonishing tone tells me that. I do not plan on returning. Also, I have been seated next to people who used a credit card to pay for their meals but have been near others who cleburne's will not allow to use the same. I think a sign should be posted before entry if a place does not accept credit cards. By the same token why are some able to use them. It is visible when personnel comes back to table to return credit card and get persons signature. I have seen this on more than one occasion. I really don't think the owner would have treated this situation as the cashier did but seems to me this should not have been handled like this.

I had high hopes for this restaurant because of the reviews I had seen online. FOOD; the food was great! The dishes were terrific and it is very evident that most dishes are made from scratch. Make sure to try the desserts if you go! Now the STAFF on the other hand was my main problem. My whole family ordered the fish platter which clearly (as stated on the menu) included catfish, fries, crab cake, oysters and shrimp. After getting my plate, I noticed that there were no shrimp. I had eaten none of this platter and it was arranged just the way I had gotten it. I spoke to the lady at the cash register and she tried to convince me that i was supposed to pay EXTRA money for the shrimp. I then went to another lady (who i am certain was the manager) and she questioned me to whether i had already eaten the shrimp already!! How rude!! After i responded with a solid ""no"", she said ""ok, I will give you some shrimp, but it only comes with three"". The main reason I picked this dish was because I had seen someone else with this plate, and it looked very delicious. I was 100% certain that there plate had included at least 6 pieces of shrimp. And in my families plates, they all had 5 pieces of shrimp. I questioned her about this, and she told me that ""they're just lucky that they got that many cause we never serve that many shrimp to anyone"". I was in disbelief. Many people had gotten the same seafood platter and had had more than 5 shrimps, she was completely lying to me.

The cheese topping was in a big blob, not melted into the potato. The green beans were fresh and okay. My husband ordered the liver and onions. He said the liver was paper thin and very dry.

It's $27.00 that I'll never get back. I always heard this place was a 'high end' cafeteria-a better quality Luby's. The only thing that was 'high end' was the price. The food was much worse than Luby's AND more expensive. My roast beef was tough, dry and overcooked. The mac-n-cheese was okay. The corn was, well, corn. The cornbread was dry too. My wife had the fried fish which was decent. Her broccoli was undercooked. The cucumber/tomato salad sucked. They basically just chopped up cucumbers and tomatoes and put them in a bowl-no dressing, no vinegar marinade, nothing! When walking through the line, even the chicken fried steak looked terrible. The skin was moist like they fried then and covered them up for a moment before displaying it to serve. How do you screw up chicken fried steak!!!??? I wasn't expecting some gourmet meal. I knew it was a cafeteria. However, I was expecting something better than Luby's and it was quite the opposite. Luby's has better quality food, better prepared and more choices. The worst part, Cleburne only accepts cash or check. That's ridiculous in 2011. I have no earthly idea why this place has been there for so long if they are putting out food like this. I guess the only bright spot was the staff was very nice and attentive. If you just have a craving for cafeteria food, go to Luby's. Don't settle for this place just because it's close to you.

I went to Cleburne because I was told that the fried chicken was good. So..... I ordered white meat, mac and cheese, baked squash, a yeast roll, and a slice of chocolate cream pie. The chicken was burned. The mac and cheese was bland. The squash was covered in toasted corn flakes and was tasteless. The yeast roll was yeasty, but cold and, as Frasier once said ""the hardest role since Hamlet."" The pie was too sweet to eat. The whole thing cost me almost $17.00.

First trip about six months ago brought me there with a friend to grab some lunch and kill some time. As we came to the end of the line to pay we both pulled out our credit cards and were looked at like we just broke some unspoken rule. Sorry fellas, we don't take credit cards, only cash. After a minor standoff we decided to bounce and were immediately stopped and told we could use our cards only this time, no other. So you have a credit card machine but hassle people because you are too cheap to pay the 4% fee that comes along with them while charging outrageous prices (I'll get to that later). Well, the two of us for some reason decided to head back to Cleburne for lunch today. Guess we forgot how nice you're treated once inside. I'll try to keep this brief. Asked the lady serving entrees what one item was, got my answer, then asked about another. She proceeded to tell me what everything out there was and scooped a slice of cod up to put on a plate. I said I was just wondering what it was and did not want it. She then slammed the plate down, skipped over my friend, and asked the patron behind us what he wanted. Excuse me I'll take the chicken. Oh was she pissy. If you don't like your job, leave lady. I then got up to pay (yes I brought cash) and the lady dropped my change (a bill) right a woman's turkey and dressing. The customer looked at me, the worker picked it off her plate (gravy attached) and gave me a clean bill back. I was off and so was the woman. They didn't even ask her if she wanted another. Good thing you can see what happens with your food and they don't prepare it in the back. As I sat down my friend came over to sit down, broke. His lunch was $19. All he had was cod and two sides. Come to find out the cod was $12; guess it was flown in this morning from the Atlantic. This was my last trip ever to Cleburne; keep up the great work and you may stay open for another few years at most. Credit cards accepted - Only after making you feel like you don't belong here. Reasonably priced - Ha! I'd hate to know what you'd charge for kids plates; $12?Attitude while ordering - You bet.Would I recommend - No; go to Luby's, get 3 LuAnn platters, and you'll come out ahead.","alt=""1.0 star rating""",1,cleburne-cafeteria-houston-2,cleburne-cafeteria-houstonhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/cleburne-cafeteria-houston-2?start=140,Derek S.,"Washington, DC",90,46,1,,3/11/09,"I have been going to Cleburne's for over 12 years and the food is always fresh and the experience is good.
